;[Intro];Come here;I don't know what happened;;[Verse 1];Where did they go?;Nights like this dont happen anymore;I need to know;Is it me? and did I lose control? (Slow it down);;[Pre-Chorus];Lonely overseas;Only memories;Wish I had the key to your heart;People come and go;Baby,, they dont know;What we had before;But it fell before our eyes;;[Chorus];Roller coaster,, roller coaster;Spinning all around and around for a while baby;Roller coaster,, roller coaster;For a minute we were up,, but the next we were falling down;;[Verse 2];It's been difficult;I'm just happy there's no fights no more;But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more;There's a reason what this happened for (But I can't help but feel like);;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;;[Bridge];Bounce...;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus]
