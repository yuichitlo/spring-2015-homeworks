;[Intro];If you could take my pulse right now;It would feel just like a sledgehammer;If you could feel my heart beat now;It would hit you like a sledgehammer;;[Verse 1];I don't admit it;I play it cool;But every minute;That I'm with you;I feel the fever and I won't lie;I break a sweat;My body's telling;All the secrets I ain't told you yet;;[Pre-Chorus];I struggle to contain;The love that's in my veins;And how it circulates;;[Chorus];If you could take my pulse right now;It would feel just like a sledgehammer;If you could feel my heart beat now;It would hit you like a sledgehammer;You're taken over the beat of my body;You just don't let up,, don't let up;You're taken over the beat of my body;But you lift me up,, lift me up;If you take my pulse right now;It would feel just like a sledgehammer;;[Verse 2];So close together;So far apart;You're turning me on;And my fire's waitin' for your spark;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Bridge];The truth is out,, no stopping now;I'm getting closer,, I've had enough;Undress my love,, I'm coming over;;[Chorus]
