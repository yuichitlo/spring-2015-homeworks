;[Verse 1];If you ever leave me,, baby;Leave some morphine at my door;Cause it would take a whole lot of medication;To realize what we used to have;We don't have it anymore;;There's no religion that could save me;No matter how long my knees are on the floor,, oh;So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making;To keep you by my side;To keep you from walking out the door;;[Chorus];Cause there'll be no sunlight;If I lose you,, baby;There'll be no clear skies;If I lose you,, Baby;Just like the clouds;My eyes will do the same if you walk away;Everyday,, it will rain;Rain,, rain;;[Verse 2];I'll never be your mother's favorite;Your daddy can't even look me in the eye;Ooh if I was in their shoes,, I'd be doing the same thing;Saying there goes my little girl;Walking with that troublesome guy;;But they're just afraid of something they can't understand;Ooh well little darling watch me change their minds;Yea for you I'll try,, I'll try,, I'll try;I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding;If that'll make you mine;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Ooh Don't you say;Goodbye,, don't just say,, goodbye;I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding;If that'll make it right;;[Chorus]
