;[Verse 1];Well I'm so above you,, it is plain to see;But I came to love you anyway;So you pulled my heart out;And I don't mind bleeding;Any old time you keep me waiting,, waiting,, waiting;;[Chorus];Oh,, oh,, oh,, oh,, I got a love that keeps me waiting;I'm a lonely boy;;[Verse 2];Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you;And I should have done you just the same;But I came to love you;And I want to believe you;Any old time you keep me waiting,, waiting,, waiting;;[Chorus];Oh,, I got a girl that keeps waiting;I'm a lonely boy
