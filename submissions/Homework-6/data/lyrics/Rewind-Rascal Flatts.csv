;[Verse 1];Wish I could reach up and reset that sun;Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up;Went by so fast oh so sweet;Make me wanna remake a memory;Wish I had me a time machine;Oh;;[Chorus];I float the moon back up in the sky;Put a cork back into that sweet red wine;Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time;Untouch your skin;Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again;So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind;;[Verse 2];I turn back that radio dial,, reopen your door;Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore;Re-spin you around replay that sound,, of you laughing when we hit the ground;I can see it now how bout we;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I wanna re-fall and re-fly;Baby re-live this night;;[Chorus];;[Outro];I'm wishing I could rewind;I wanna relive this night;So good,, so right
