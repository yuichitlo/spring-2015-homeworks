;[Produced by Mark Endert];;[Verse 1];You can be amazing;You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug;You can be the outcast;Or be the backlash of somebodys lack of love;Or you can start speaking up;Nothings gonna hurt you the way that words do;When they settle neath your skin;Kept on the inside and no sunlight;Sometimes a shadow wins;But I wonder what would happen if you;;[Chorus];Say what you wanna say;And let the words fall out;Honestly I wanna see you be brave;With what you want to say;And let the words fall out;Honestly I wanna see you be brave;;[Post-Chorus];I just wanna see you [x3];I wanna see you be brave;I just wanna see you [x3];I wanna see you be brave;;[Verse 2];Everybodys been there;Everybodys been stared down by the enemy;Fallen for the fear;And done some disappearing;Bow down to the mighty;Dont run,, stop holding your tongue;Maybe theres a way out of the cage where you live;Maybe one of these days you can let the light in;Show me how big your brave is;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And since your history of silence;Won't do you any good;Did you think it would?;Let your words be anything but empty;Why don't you tell them the truth?;;[Chorus + Post Chorus];;[Outro];I just wanna see you [x6]
