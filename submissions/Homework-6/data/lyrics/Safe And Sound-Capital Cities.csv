;[Verse 1];I could lift you up;I could show you what you want to see;And take you where you want to be;;[Verse 2];You could be my luck;Even if the sky is falling down;I know that we'll be safe and sound;We're safe and sound;;I could fill your cup;You know my river won't evaporate;This world we still appreciate;;You could be my luck;Even in a hurricane of frowns;I know that we'll be safe and sound (safe and sound);;[Chorus];We're safe and sound (safe and sound);We're safe and sound (hold your ground);We're safe and sound (safe and sound);;I could show you love;In a tidal wave of mystery;You'll still be standing next to me;;You could be my luck;Even if we're six feet underground;I know that we'll be safe and sound;We'll safe and sound;;[Chorus];(Safe and sound);(Safe and sound);(Hold your ground);(Safe and sound);;[Verse 1];;[Verse 2];;[Verse 1];;[Chorus]
