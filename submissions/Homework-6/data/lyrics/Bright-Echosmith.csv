;[Verse 1];I think the universe is on my side;Heaven and earth have finally aligned;Days are good and that's they way it should be;;You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case;It's like a moon beam brushed across my face;Nights are good and that's the way it should be;;[Pre-Chorus];You make me sing oooh,, la la la;You make a girl go oooh;I'm in love,, love;;[Chorus];Did you see that shooting star tonight?;Were you dazzled by the same constellation?;Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?;I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right;Cause now I'm shining bright,, so bright;;[Verse 2];And I see colors in a different way;You make what doesn't matter fade to grey;Life is good and that's the way it should be;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;And I get lost in your eyes tonight;;[Chorus]
