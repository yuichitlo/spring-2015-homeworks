;[Verse 1: Harry];Maybe it's the way she walked;Straight into my heart and stole it;Through the doors and past the guards;Just like she already owned it;;[Pre-Chorus: Zayn];I said can you give it back to me;She said,, Never in your wildest dreams;;[Chorus];And we danced all night to the best song ever;We knew every line now I can't remember;How it goes but I know that I won't forget her;Cause we danced all night to the best song ever;I think it went oh,, oh,, oh;I think it went yeah,, yeah,, yeah;I think it goes...;;[Verse 2: Liam];Said her name was Georgia Rose;And her daddy was a dentist;Said I had a dirty mouth;But she kissed me like she meant it;;[Pre-Chorus: Niall];I said can I take you home with me;She said never in your wildest dreams;;[Chorus];;[Bridge: Louis];You know,, I know,, you know I'll remember you;And I know,, you know,, I know you'll remember me;And you know,, I know,, you know I'll remember you;And I know,, you know,, I hope you'll remember how we danced;(yeah yeah yeah) how we danced;1,, 2 - 1,, 2,, 3;;[Chorus x2]
