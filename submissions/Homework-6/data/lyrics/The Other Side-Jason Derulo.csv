;[Prod. by Joshua Ammo Coleman and Martin Johnson];;[Verse 1: Jason Derulo];In the beginning,, I never thought it would be you;When we were chilling,, smiling in the photo booth;But we got closer,, till you were eating off my spoon;You're coming over,, and we would talk all afternoon;;[Pre-Hook: Jason Derulo];Tonight well just get drunk,, disturb the peace;Bind your hands all over me;And then you bite your lip,, whisper and say;Were going all the way;;[Hook: Jason Derulo];Tonight,, take me to the other side;Sparks fly like the 4th of July;Just take me to the other side;I see that sexy look in your eyes;And I know we aint friends anymore;If we walk down this road,, well be lovers for sure;So tonight,, kiss me like its do or die;And take me to the other side;;[Verse 2: Jason Derulo];This could be perfect,, but we wont know unless we try;I know youre nervous,, so just sit back and let me drive;;[Pre-Hook + Hook];;[Interlude];;[Pre-Hook + Hook]
