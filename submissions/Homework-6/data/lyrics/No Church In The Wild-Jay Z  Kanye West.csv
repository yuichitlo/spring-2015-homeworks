;[Intro];;It's About Time;But first,, let me give you a little background on this song;So basically,, I was coming home right?;And I was listening to the original song on the radio;And it came to the hook,, and I gotta tell you;I really didn't like it you know what I'm saying? So,, me being the Angel of Hip-Hop;I felt like it was my duty to respond to this in one way or another so;You know cause there's a lot of stuff going on the media,, in the industry,, T.V. and all this stuff;And it's like,, I gotta respond cause it's not right,, what's going on;;[Verse 1: Angel];;I'm not a Christian Rapper,, I'm a rapper that's Christian;I got a message that half of ya won't even listen;But ya already know the flow is why you tune in;Soon and thereafter you'll realize soon is the rapture;I respect all religions,, but this is my belief;I only got few minutes in this so let Angel be brief;The media's got you deceived,, and that's not an opinion;Many are sinning just because they're the media's minions;But the devil ain't winning,, I'm a rebel admitting;That damn son,, my name is Angel cause I am one;You're just foul cause I'm fly,, so thanks for the And 1;Sick of seeing souls getting taken for ransom;So God,, make it all stop and have em understand me;It's not normal to do an exorcism at a Grammy;Unfortunately this ain't the first time I've seen this in life;Yeah I've been watching the throne,, but I only seen Jesus Christ;;[Hook: Th3 Saga];;I believe in a God,, who provides everything;Who defeats every odd,, so what's a God to his believers?;If you believe he's everything?;The reason I'm alive;Alright,, alright;This is Church In The Wild;;[Verse 2: Th3 Saga];;Uh,, my mother's always singing in a church;She's a monster for me to say the least;She had a c-section from a birth;So I guess that I came from the belly of a beast;The doctor told her I'll be paralyzed,, from the neck down;Get a real abortion,, 21 years later I'm in Five Towns;And I'm giving out that word like the Wheel of Fortune;He made a way,, I entered the direction;He told me let it go,, surrender the depression;Then I became Shaquille if you wanna hear the real;In other words,, I became the Center of Attention;The mind-state of legendary was secondary;I'm just trying to answer my call like a secretary;So before this ether is done,, just love God and Live Equal 2 None;No Genre...
