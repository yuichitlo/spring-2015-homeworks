;[Verse 1];I have been dragging' around your sensitive ego;Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show;A little suitcase like a brick;It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip;I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt;I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself;;[Chorus];At the baggage claim,, you got a lot of luggage in your name;When you hit the ground,, check the lost and found;Cause it ain't my problem now;I can't carry it on,, I've got a lot of troubles on my own;It's all over the yard,, in the trunk of the car;I'm packing' it in,, so come and get it;;[Verse 2];If it ain't obvious what has set me off today;Behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way;Go on and take your little business trip;With that sweet little habit that you can't kick;You better call your momma when you get to town;Cause I ain't gonna be hanging' around;;[Chorus];;[Break];Come and get it!;;[Verse 3];Come and pick it up,, pick it up;Before I blow it up in flames;You better pick it up,, pick it up;Baby,, I'm leaving everything;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Come and get your shit!
