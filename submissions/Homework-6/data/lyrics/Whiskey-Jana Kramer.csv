;[Verse 1];Everybody down in Houston calls him Texas;Everybody way up North calls him Cornbread;You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him baby;Daddy called him boy,, his friends call him crazy;;[Chorus];Shoulda just called it like I saw it;Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day;The burn and the sting,, and the high,, and the heat;And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me;I shoulda just called him whiskey;;[Verse 2];Warm my body to the core just like a blanket;His face was so sweet then he took my breath away;Hit me so hard like a rock through a window;I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you,, boy;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Now the numb has set in;He's gone like the wind;And I can barely feel the pain;;[Chorus]
