;[Verse 1: Kristen];The window is open,, so's that door;I didn't know they did that anymore;Who knew we owned a thousand salad plates?;For years I've roamed these empty halls;Why have a ballroom with no balls?;Finally they're opening the gates;;[Pre-Chorus: Kristen];There'll be actual,, real-life people;It'll be totally strange;Wow,, am I so ready for this change;;[Chorus 1: Kristen];Cause for the first time in forever;There'll be music,, there'll be light;For the first time in forever;I'll be dancing through the night;Don't know if I'm elated or gassy;But I'm somewhere in the zone;Cause for the first time in forever;I won't be alone;;I can't wait to meet everyone!;Oh,, what if I meet the one?;;[Verse 2: Kristen];Tonight,, imagine me,, gown and all;Fetchingly draped against the wall;The picture of sophisticated grace;I suddenly see him standing there;A beautiful stranger,, tall and fair;I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face;;[Pre-Chorus: Kristen];But then we laugh and talk all evening;Which is totally bizarre;Nothing like the life I've led so far;;[Chorus 2: Kristen];For the first time in forever;There'll be magic,, there'll be fun;For the first time in forever;I could be noticed by someone;And I know it is totally crazy;To dream I'd find romance;But for the first time in forever;At least I've got a chance;;[Bridge: Idina];Don't let them in;Don't let them see;Be the good girl you always have to be;Conceal,, don't feel;Put on a show;Make one wrong move and everyone will know;;[Climb: Idina (and Kristen)];But it's only for today (it's only for today);It's agony to wait (it's agony to wait);Tell the guards to open up the gates (the gates);;[Chorus 3: Kristen (and Idina)];For the first time in forever (don't let them in,, don't let them see);I'm getting what I'm dreaming of (be the good girl you always have to be);A chance to change my lonely world (conceal);A chance to find true love (conceal,, don't feel,, don't let them know);;[Coda: Kristen];I know it all ends tomorrow;So it has to be today;Cause for the first time in forever;For the first time in forever;Nothing's in my way!
