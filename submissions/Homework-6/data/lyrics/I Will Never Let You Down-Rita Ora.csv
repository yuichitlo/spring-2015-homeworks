;[Verse 1];Tell me baby what we gonna do;I'll make it easy,, got a lot to lose;Watch the sunlight coming through;Open the window,, let it shine on you;;[Pre-Chorus];Cuz I've been sick and working all week;And I've been doing just fine;You've been tired of watching me;Forgot to have a good time boy;You can't take it,, all these faces;Never keeping it real;I know exactly how you feel;;[Chorus];When you say you've had enough;And you might just give it up;Oh Ooh,, I Will Never Let You Down;When you're feeling low on love;I'll be what you're dreaming of;Oh Ooh,, I Will Never Let You Down;Oh Ooh,, I Will Never Let You Down;;[Verse 2];There's a million ways to go;Don't be embarrassed if you lose control;On the rooftop,, now they know;Your body's frozen and you've lost your soul;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];Let me take you where you never go;Have a little fun,, it's the only way we know;Let me show you what you never see;You know how to love,, only when you're holding me;;[Chorus]
