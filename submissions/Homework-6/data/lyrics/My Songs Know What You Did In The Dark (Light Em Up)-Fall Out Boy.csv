;[Verse 1];Be careful making wishes in the dark;Can't be sure when they've hit their mark;Besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart;I'm in the details with the devil;So now the world can never get me on my level;I just got to get you out of the cage;I'm a young lovers rage;Gonna need a spark to ignite;;[Bridge];My songs know what you did in the dark;;[Chorus];So light em up,, up,, up;Light em up,, up,, up;Light em up,, up,, up;I'm on fire [x2];;[Verse 2];All the writers keep writing what they write;Somewhere another pretty vein just dies;I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see;That you're the antidote to everything except for me;A constellation of tears on your lashes;Burn everything you love;Then burn the ashes;In the end everything collides;My childhood spat back out the monster that you see;;[Bridge &amp,; Chorus x2]
