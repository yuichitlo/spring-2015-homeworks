;[Verse 1];Center of attention once again;They don't understand;They don't understand,, no;Then they try to tell me who I am;But they don't understand;They don't understand,, no;;[Pre-Chorus];You want a perfect picture to believe in;Then you can't be looking for me then;;[Chorus];I don't need to live by your rules (you don't control me);Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (you don't know me);And I know,, I know,, I know you don't like it;You don't,, you don't,, you don't know where I've been;It's my life so truth be told;;[Post-Chorus];I see you thinking but there's just one thing dear;You think you know but you don't have no idea;Think you know me but there's more to see,, my love;;[Verse 2];The same arguments time and time again;And you watch them all happen;But they don't understand,, no;Thinkin' you're the reason that it ends;And he won't be back again;But they don't understand,, no;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Bridge];You don't know me;The girl you see in photographs is only;A part of the one I am,, don't judge me;Cause that's not reality and all I can be;Is in love with who I'm becoming;(Think you know me but there's more to see,, my love);(Think you know but you don't have no idea);;[Chorus x2] + [Post-Chorus];;[Outro];My love
