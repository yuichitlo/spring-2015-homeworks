;[Verse 1];Around these parts ain't much to do;Except work like a dog until Friday;Punch that clock,, cash that check;Raise a little hell until Sunday;About that time;There's a party back in the woods tonight;Heard it through the redneck grapevine;Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls;Sure enough going to be a good time;;[Chorus];It's a small town throwdown;It's time to tallboy up,, let them tailgates down;And man,, it's on tonight,, riding until the morning light;Crank that country up loud,, it's a small town throwdown;;[Verse 2];Oh,, we about to throwdown,, son;Now we got a field full of daisy dukes;Round here we know how to grow them;Rocking little body and long tan legs;Sure ain't scared to show them,, no;Show a little something,, girl;Somebody said them city boys;Riding around looking for some trouble;If they bring it across that county line;You know there's gonna be a rumble;;[Chorus][x3];;[Outro];That's country
