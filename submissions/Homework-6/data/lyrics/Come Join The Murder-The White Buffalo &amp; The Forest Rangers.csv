;[Instrumental Intro];;[Verse 1];There's a black bird perched outside my window;I hear him calling;I hear him sing;He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers;He sees all my sins;He reads my soul;;[Pre-Chorus];One day that bird,, he spoke to me;Like Martin Luther;Like Pericles;;[Chorus];Come join the murder;Come fly with black;We'll give you freedom;From the human trap;Come join the murder;Soar on my wings;You'll touch the hand of God;And He'll make you king;And He'll make you king;;[Verse 2];On a blanket made of woven shadows;Flew up to heaven;On a raven's glide;These angels have turned my wings to wax now;I fell like Judas grace denied;;[Pre-Chorus];On that day that he lied to me;Like Martin Luther;Like Pericles;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];I walk among the children of my fathers;The broken wings,, betrayal's cost;They call to me but never touch my heart,, no;I am too far;I'm too lost;;[Pre-Chorus];All I can hear is what he spoke to me;Like Martin Luther;Like Pericles;;[Chorus];;[Guitar Interlude];;[Verse 4];So now I curse that raven's fire;You made me hate,, you made me burn;He laughed aloud as he flew from Eden;You always knew,, you never learn;;[Pre-Chorus];The crow no longer sings to me;Like Martin Luther;Or Pericles;;[Chorus] x2
