;Roll in the bar,, me and my crew;Their little plan to get me over you;They're hookin me up,, yeah;Buyin me drinks with a thousand girls;There's just one thing;;[Chorus:];I can't go anywhere,, I can't do anything;No,, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams;You won't leave me alone,, even though I know you're gone;I look around for someone new,, but I see you;Jumpin up there with the band;Takin me by the hand;Hey boy,, come dance with me;Stuck like a melody in my head;In the bed of my truck;By the light of the midnight moon;Baby,, I see you;;Don't know what you did,, but you done it good;You don't know how bad that I wish I could;Delete you from my phone,, find a girl and take her home;But there's just one thing wrong;;[Repeat Chorus];;Your lips,, your eyes;Girl,, since you told me goodbye;;[Repeat Chorus];;Baby,, I see you;Baby,, I see you
