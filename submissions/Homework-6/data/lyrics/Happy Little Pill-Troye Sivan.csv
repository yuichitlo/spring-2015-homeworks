;[Verse 1];In the crowd,, alone;Every second passing;Reminds me I'm not home;Bright lights,, city sounds;Ringing like a drone;Unknown,, unknown;;[Pre-Chorus];Glazed eyes,, empty hearts;Buying happy from shopping carts;Nothing but time to kill;Sipping life from bottles;Tight skin,, bodyguards;Gucci down the boulevard;Cocaine,, dollar bills and;;[Chorus];My happy little pill;Take me away;Dry my eyes;Bring colour to my skies;My sweet little pill;Take my hunger;Lie within;Numb my skin;;[Verse 2];Like a rock,, I float;Sweating conversations;Seep into my bones;Four walls are not enough;I'll take a dip into the;Unknown,, unknown;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus] (x2)
