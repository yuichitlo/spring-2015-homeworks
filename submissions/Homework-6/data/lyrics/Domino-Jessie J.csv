;[Verse 1];I'm feeling sexy and free;Like glitter's raining on me;You're like a shot of pure gold;I think I'm 'bout to explode;;[Pre-Chorus];I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air;Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there;Don't you know,, you spin me out of control;Ooh ooh ooh ooh;;We can do this all night,, damn this love is skin tight;Baby,, come on,, ooh ooh ooh ooh;Boom me like a bass drum,, sparkin' up a rhythm;Baby,, come on,, ooh ooh ooh ooh;;[Chorus];Rock my world until the sunlight;Make this dream the best I've ever known;Dirty dancing in the moonlight;Take me down like I'm a domino;Every second is a highlight;When we touch,, don't ever let me go;Dirty dancing in the moonlight;Take me down like I'm a domino;;[Verse 2];You got me losing my mind;My heart beats out of time;I'm seeing Hollywood stars;You strum me like a guitar;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge X4];Ooh baby,, baby,, got me feeling so right;Ooh baby,, baby,, dancing in the moonlight;;[Interlude];Ooh baby,, baby...;Ooh ooh ooh ooh;;[Chorus]
