;[Verse 1];I've been burning bright;For so long I can't remember;Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work;Believe me when I say,, I can't stay this high forever;This man has had all he can stand,, time to lay this body down;;[Chorus 1];Sweet Annie;Can I stay with you a while;Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart;Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy;But one day,, lightning will strike;And my bark will lose its bite;But don't give up on me;Sweet Annie;;[Verse 2];Sweet Annie;I know I promised you life;But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight;If I could take back yesterday,, find a way to start it over;Turn around,, put that bottle down and I pray it's not too late;;[Chorus 2];Sweet Annie;Can I stay with you a while;Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart;Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy;But one day,, lightning will strike;And my bark will lose its bite;But don't give up on me;What will be will be;Sweet Annie;;[Verse 3];Sweet Annie;Turn out the light;These hands are made to hold you;Fall all over you;All over again;Come a little closer so I can show you;My heart still beats fast for you;All over,, and over again;;[Chorus 1]
