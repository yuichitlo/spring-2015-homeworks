;Part 1: Not a Bad Thing[Verse 1];Said all I want from you;Is to see you tomorrow;And every tomorrow;Maybe youll let me borrow,, your heart;And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?;And while we're at it throw in every other day to start;;[Pre-Chorus];I know people make promises all the time;Then they turn right around and break them;When someone cuts your heart open with a knife;Now you're bleeding;But I could be that guy to heal it over time;And I wont stop until you believe it;Cause baby youre worth it;;[Chorus];So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me;Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me;Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free;So don't act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me,, me;Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me,, me;Fall,, yeah;;[Verse 2];Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?;And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are;And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me;Cause I know thats a good place to start;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];No I wont fill your mind;With broken promises and wasted time;And if you fall,, youll always land right in these arms;These arms of mine;;[Chorus]
