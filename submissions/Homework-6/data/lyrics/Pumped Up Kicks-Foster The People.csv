;[Verse 1];Roberts got a quick hand;Hell look around the room;He wont tell you his plan;Hes got a rolled cigarette;Hanging out his mouth hes a cowboy kid;Yeah,, he found a 6-shooter gun;In his dad's closet;In a box of fun things;I dont even know what;But hes coming for you;Yeah,, hes coming for you;;[Hook X2];All the other kids with the pumped up kicks;You better run,, better run,, outrun my gun;All the other kids with the pumped up kicks;You better run,, better run,, faster than my bullet;;[Verse 2];Daddy works a long day;He be coming home late;And hes coming home late;And hes bringing me a surprise;Cause dinners in the kitchen;And its packed in ice;I've waited for a long time;Yeah,, the sleight of my hand;Is now a quick pull trigger;I reason with my cigarette;Then say Your hairs on fire;You must've lost your wits,, yeah?
