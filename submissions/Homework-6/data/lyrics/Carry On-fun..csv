;[Verse 1];Well I woke up to the sound of silence;The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight;And I found you with a bottle of wine;Your head in the curtains;And heart like the fourth of July;;[Verse 2];You swore and said;We are not;We are not shining stars;This I know;I never said we are;;[Bridge];Though I've never been through hell like that;I've closed enough windows;To know you can never look back;;[Hook];If you're lost and alone;Or you're sinking like a stone;Carry on;May your past be the sound;Of your feet upon the ground;Carry on;Carry on,, carry on;;[Verse 3];So I met up with some friends;At the edge of the night;At a bar off 75;And we talked and talked;About how our parents will die;All our neighbours and wives;;[Verse 4];But I'd like to think;I can cheat it all;To make up for the times I've been cheated on;And it's nice to know;When I was left for dead;I was found and now I don't roam these streets;I am not the ghost you want of me;;[Hook];;[Interlude];Woah;My head is on fire;But my legs are fine;After all they are mine;Lay your clothes down on the floor;Close the door;Hold the phone;Show me how;No one's ever gonna stop us now;;[Verse 5];Cause we are;We are shining stars;We are invincible;We are who we are;On our darkest day;When we're miles away;So we'll come;We will find our way home;;[Hook];;[Outro];No one's ever gonna stop us now
