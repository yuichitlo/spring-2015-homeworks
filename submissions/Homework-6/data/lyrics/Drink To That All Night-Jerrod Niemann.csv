;[Verse 1];Dontcha look now oh the parking lots full;Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull;Everybody in the ATL is coming;DJs got those speakers thumping;Got a Black Ford not a White Mercedes;Walking in the front door checking out the ladies;My buddy says hey boys,, I'm buying;The hottest girl in here's giving me the eye and;;[Chorus];Everybody knows,, it's gonna be one of those;I can drink to that all night;That's the stuff I like;That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high;Bout to tie one on;Talking gone gone gone;Turning all the wrongs into right;I can drink to that all night;;[Verse 2];Workin on the sweet thing sittin on a bar stool;Doin shots of Jack,, girl gonna take it old school;Singin hell yeah to every song their playing;Do ya wanna dance? Baby I'm just saying;;[Chorus];;Yeah,, I can drink to that all night;;[Bridge];Take your cup,, fill it up;You can't raise it high enough;Take your cup,, fill it up;You can't raise it high enough;;[Final Chorus];Everybody knows,, it's gonna be one of those;I can drink to that all night;That's the stuff I like;That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up;I can drink to that all night;That's the stuff I like;That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high;Bout to tie one on;Talkin gone gone gone;Turning all the wrongs into right;I can drink to that all night;I can drink to that all night;I can drink to that all night;;[Bridge]
