;[Verse 1: Gary];I came up out of the water;Raised my hands up to the Father;Gave it all to him that day;Felt a new wind kiss my face;Walked away,, Eyes wide open;Could finally see where I was going;It didn't matter where I'd been;I'm not the same man I was then;;[Chorus];I got off track;I made mistakes;Back slid my way;Into that place;Where souls get lost;Lines get crossed;And the pain wont go away;I hit my knees;Now here I stand;There I was;Now here I am;Here I am;Changed;;[Verse 2: Gary];I got a lot of Hey,, Im sorry's;The things Ive done;Man,, that was not me;I wish that I could take it all back;I just want to tell em that;Tell 'em that;;[Chorus];;[Bridge: Gary];I'm changed for the better;More smiles,, less bitter;I'm even starting to forgive myself;;[Outro];I hit my knee;Im here I stand;There I was;Now here I am;Here I am,, Here I am,, Here I am;Changed;Yes I am;Im changed for the better;Thank God I'm changed
