;[Produced by Joel Little];;[Verse 1];There's a humming in the restless summer air;And we're slipping off the course that we prepared;But in all chaos,, there is calculation;Dropping glasses just to hear them break;You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't);Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure);It's clear that someone's gotta go;We mean it,, but I promise we're not mean;;[Pre-Chorus];And the cry goes out (oh!);They lose their minds for us;And how it plays out (oh!);Now we're in the ring;And we're coming for blood;;[Chorus];You could try and take us;But we're the gladiators;Everyone a rager;But secretly they're saviors;Glory and gore go hand in hand;That's why we're making headlines;You could try and take us;But victory's contagious;;[Verse 2];Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay);God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way);Chance is the only game I play with,, baby;We let our battles choose us;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed;The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home;Tired little laughs,, gold lie promises,, we'll always win at this;I don't ever think about death;It's alright if you do,, it's fine;We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves;Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes;Wide awake in bed,, words in my brain,, Secretly you love this;Do you even wanna go free?;Let me in the ring,, I'll show you what that big word means;;[Chorus]
