;[Verse 1];I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two;But it turned into a party when I started talking to you;Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on;Baby it's your call,, no pressure at all;;[Chorus];You dont have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer;You dont have to keep on smiling that smile thats driving me wild and when the night is almost over;Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song,, hanging on;You dont have to keep me fallin like this;But itd sure be cool if you did;;[Verse 2];You cant shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead;Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head;Let your mind take a little back road;Just as far as you wanna go;Baby Ill do whatever you wanna do;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Have a night that you'll never forget;And now you're standing in the neon;Looking like a high I wanna be on;;[Chorus]
