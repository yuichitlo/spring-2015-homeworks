;[Chorus];Say something,, I'm giving up on you;I'll be the one,, if you want me to;Anywhere,, I would've followed you;Say something,, I'm giving up on you;;[Verse 1];And I am feeling so small;It was over my head;I know nothing at all;And I will stumble and fall;I'm still learning to love;Just starting to crawl;;[Chorus 2];Say something,, I'm giving up on you;I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you;Anywhere,, I would've followed you;Say something,, I'm giving up on you;;[Verse 2];And I will swallow my pride;You're the one that I love;And I'm saying goodbye;;[Chorus 2];;[Outro];Say something,, I'm giving up on you;Say something...
