;[Verse 1];I fell down,, down,, down;Into this dark and lonely hole;There was no one there to care about me anymore;And i needed a way to climb and and grab a hold,, of the edge;You were sitting there holding a rope;;[Chorus];And we'll go up,, up,, up;But I'll fly a little higher;Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer;Up Here,, My Dear;It won't be long now,, it won't be long now;;[Verse 2];When we get back on land;Well I'll never get my chance;Be ready to live and it'll be ripped;Right out of my hands;And maybe someday;We'll take a little ride;We'll go up,, up,, up;And everything will be just fine;;[Chorus];And we'll go up,, up,, up;But I'll fly a little higher;Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer;Up Here,, My Dear;It won't be long now,, it won't be long now;;[Bridge];If only I had a little bit more time;If only I had a little bit more time with you;;[Verse 3];We could go up,, up,, up;And take a little ride;We'll sit there holding hands and everything will;Be just right;And maybe someday I'll see you again;We'll float up in the clouds and we'll;Never see the end;;[Chorus];And we'll go up,, up,, up;But I'll fly a little higher;Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer;Up Here,, My Dear;It won't be long now,, it won't be long now
