;Waiting in the car;Waiting for the ride in the dark;At night the city grows;Look and see the horizon glow;;Waiting in a car;Waiting for a ride in the dark;Drinking in the lights;Following the neon signs;;Waiting for a roar;Looking at the mutated skyline;The city is my church;It wraps me in its blinding twilight;;Waiting in a car;Waiting for a ride in the dark;Waiting in a car;Waiting for a ride in the dark;Waiting in a car;Waiting for a ride in the dark;Waiting in a car;Waiting for a ride in the dark
