;[Chorus];Kiss me hard before you go;Summertime sadness;I just wanted you to know;That baby,, you the best;;[Verse 1];I got my red dress on tonight;Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight;Done my hair up real big,, beauty queen style;High heels off,, I'm feeling alive;;[Bridge];Oh,, my God,, I feel it in the air;Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare;Honey I'm on fire,, I feel it everywhere;Nothing scares me anymore;;[Chorus];;[Verse 2];I'm feelin' electric tonight;Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99;Got my bad baby by my heavenly side;I know if I go,, I'll die happy tonight;;[Bridge];[Chorus];;[Breakdown];I've got that summertime,, summertime sadness;S-s-summertime,, summertime sadness;Got that summertime,, summertime sadness;Oh,, oh oh;;[Verse 3];I think I'll miss you forever;Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies;Later's better than never;Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive,, drive;;[Breakdown];[Chorus];[Breakdown]
