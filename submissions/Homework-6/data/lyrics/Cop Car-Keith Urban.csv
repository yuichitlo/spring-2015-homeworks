;We drove right past;That no trespassing sign;We sat on the tailgate;And watched the planes take off;;We thought we had all night;There was no need to rush;That's when those cops;Came pulling up;And I thought;Man,, ain't this some shhhh;;[Bridge];Your daddy's gonna kill me;But if I survive tonight;I wouldn't change one thing;Baby,, yeah;I know it sounds crazy;;But there was something bout the way;The blue lights were shining;Bringing out the freedom in your eyes;I was too busy watching you going wild child;To be worried about going to jail;You were thinking that running for it would make a good story;I was thinking you were crazy as hell;And you were so innocent,, but you were stealing my heart;I fell in love in the back of a cop car;;Man,, they weren't playing;They sure threw those cuffs on quick;You tried to sweet talk 'em;They didn't fall for it;But I did;You were on the left;I was on the right;I knew you didn't smoke;When you asked him for a light;And I laughed;He got mad and slammed the door;;[Bridge &amp,; Chorus];;Side by side;And locked in tight;They were taking their time;But we didn't mind;;We talked;And we laughed;We sat real close;By the time they let us go;I was already gone;;But there was something bout the way;The blue lights were shining;Bringing out the freedom in your eyes;I was too busy watching you going wild child;To be worried about going to jail;You were thinking that running for it would make a good story;I was thinking you were crazy as hell;And you were so innocent,, but you were stealing my heart;I fell in love in the back of a cop car;;Songwriter:  Sam Hunt
