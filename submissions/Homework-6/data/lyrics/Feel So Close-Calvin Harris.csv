;[Verse 1: Calvin Harris];I feel so close to you right now;It's a force field;I wear my heart upon my sleeve,, like a big deal;Your love pours down on me,, surrounds me like a waterfall;And there's no stopping us right now;I feel so close to you right now;;[Instrumental];;[Verse 1: Calvin Harris];;[Outro] (x3);And there's no stopping us right now (3 times);I feel so close to you right now...
