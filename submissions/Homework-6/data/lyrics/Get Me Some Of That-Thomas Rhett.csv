;[Verse 1:];Yeah girl,, been diggin' on you;Sippin' on drink number two;Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth;And waitin' on the right time to make my move;But I just can't wait no more;Can't let you slip out that door;Prettiest thing I ever seen before;Got me spinnin' around,, I ain't even on the dance floor;;[Chorus:];You're shakin' that money maker,, like a heart breaker,, like your college major was;Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights;Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight;I bet your kiss is a soul saver,, my favorite flavor,, want it now and later;I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad;Girl,, I gotta get me,, gotta get me some of that;Yeah gotta get me some of that;;[Verse 2:];Little more what you doin' right there;Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair;Side to side with your drink in the air;Lord have mercy now girl;Gotta get me some of you alone;We can worry 'bout it later on;Right now keep makin' this my favorite song;;[Chorus:];;[Bridge:];In my ride,, by my side,, down the highway;In the dark,, in my arms,, in your driveway;All because of that smile you threw my way;Yeah girl you got a way of;;[Chorus:];;[Final Chorus:];Yeah,, I gotta get me some of that;Oh girl,, I gotta get me some of that;Oh yeah;I bet your kiss is a soul saver,, my favorite flavor;I want it now and later
