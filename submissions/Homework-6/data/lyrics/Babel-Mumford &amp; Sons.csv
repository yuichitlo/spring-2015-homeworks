;Cause I know that time has numbered my days;And Ill go along with everything you say;But Ill ride home laughing,, look at me now;The walls of my town,, they come crumbling down;And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons;And I know their choices color all Ive done;But Ill explain it all to the watchmans son;I never lived a year better spent in love;;[Hook];Cause I know my weakness know my voice;And I believe in grace and choice;And I know perhaps my heart is farce;But Ill be born without a mask;;(Woo!);;Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride;I stretch my arms into the sky;I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now;Then the walls of my town,, they come crumbling down;You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl;As all we see will slip into the cloud;So come down from your mountain and stand where weve been;You know our breath is weak and our body thin;;Press my nose up to the glass around your heart;I shouldve known I was weaker from the start;Youll build your walls and I will play my bloody part;To tear,, tear them down;Well Im gonna tear,, tear them down;;[Hook]
