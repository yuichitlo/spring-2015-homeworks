;[Verse 1];More to love when your hands are free;Baby put your pom poms down for me;Come on shake it up 123;Baby put your pom poms down for me;;[Verse 2];Yeah they come from miles away;Just to see how you get down;Feels like an earthquake;Every time you come around;You hear em saying yeah (yeah);Every time feels like a revival (glory);So get up,, right now;Were coming for the title;;[Chorus];More to love when your hands are free;Baby put your pom poms down for me;Come on shake it up 123;Baby put your pom poms down for me;When you move I fall to my knees;Baby put your pom poms down for me;Come on shake it up 543;Baby put your pom poms down for me;;[Verse 3];I want you on my team;Want you like kid just wants a milkshake;And I wont let it go to waste if I get a taste;Im gonna drink the whole thing;You hear em saying yeah (yeah);Every time feels like a revival (glory);So get up,, right now;Were coming for the title;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Ladies to the left,, fellas to the right;If you wanna see me put my pom poms down;Then sing it to me baby sing it right now;Na na na na na na,, yeah yeah [repeat 1x];;[Chorus]
