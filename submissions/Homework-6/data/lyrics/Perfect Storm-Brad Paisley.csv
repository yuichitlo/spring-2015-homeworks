;[Verse 1];If she was a drink;She'd be a single-barrelled Bourbon on ice;Smooth with a kick;A chill and a burn all at the same time;;[Pre-Chorus];She's Sunday drive meets;High speed chase;She ain't just a song;She's the whole mixtape;She's so complicated;That's the way God made her;Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane;;;[Chorus];And she destroys me in that t-shirt;And I love her so much it hurts;I never meant to fall like this;She don't just rain she pours;That girl right there's the perfect storm;;[Verse 2];I know how to make her laugh;Or blush,, or mad at me;But that's okay there ain't no one more beautiful angry;;[Pre-Chorus 2];And she loves just as deep;As she goes when she's down;The highs match the lows;Can't have one without the other;And I love her just the way God made her;Sunshine mixed with a little hurricane;;[Chorus];And she destroys me in that t-shirt;And I love her so much it hurts;I never meant to fall like this;But she don't just rain she pours;That girl right there's the perfect storm;;[Outro];She's the girl of a lifetime;A guy like me spends his whole life;Looking for,, that girl right there's the perfect storm;Woah-oh-oh;Woah-oh-oh;She destroys me in that t-shirt
