;[Verse 1];You're not the type,, type a girl;To remain with a guy,, with a guy too shy too afraid;To say he'll give his heart to you forever;I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees;With his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please;To stay with him for worse or for better;But I'm staring at you now;There's no one else around;I'm thinking you're the girl for me;;[Chorus](2x);I'm just saying it's fine by me;If you never leave;And we can live like this forever;It's fine by me;;[Veres 2];In the past I would try;Try hard to commit to a girl;Wouldn't get too far;It always somehow seemed to fall apart;But with you I can see what I need;I can dream realistically;I knew that this was different from the start;And it seems that every time we're eye to eye;I can find another piece of you,, that I don't want to lose;I'm staring at you now;There is no one else around;I'm thinking you're the girl I need;;[Chorus](x2);;[Bridge];And it's never easy;But darling believe me;I'm as skeptical as you;But when I think of life without us;It seems like what we're supposed to do;But I don't wanna come on too strong;;[Chorus](x3)
