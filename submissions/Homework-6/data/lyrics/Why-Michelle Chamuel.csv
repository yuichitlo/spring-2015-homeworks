;[Verse 1];You can wear stilettos at the caf;You can hit the library on your birthday;You can do pilates on the subway;You can crank your heavy metal while you crochet;;[Chorus];Cause no one knows what its like to walk in your shoes,, in your shoes;Your colors show and its really nice to see you;Do what you do,, say what you say;You got to rock it your own way,, own way;Give what you give,, day after day;You got to rock it your own way,, own way;;[Verse 2];You can do karate on your first date;You can dip in the Jacuzzi in your roller skates;Rock out to this song when no one else sees;Order half a million people on the TV;;[Chorus];;[Interlude];Why would you do it any other way?;Theres no one else thats built like you;;[Bridge];Everybody wants to be down with the way they want to get down;Dont be afraid,, just rock it your own way;Everybody wants to get down,, go ahead and put your feet down;Dont be afraid,, just rock it your own way;;[Chorus + Bridge]
