;[Intro];Some nights,, I stay up cashing in my bad luck,; some nights,, I call it a draw;Some nights,, I wish that my lips could build a castle;Some nights,, I wish they'd just fall off;But I still wake up,, I still see your ghost;Oh Lord,, I'm still not sure what I stand for;What do I stand for? What do I stand for?;Most nights,, I don't know anymore...;;[Verse 1];This is it,, boys,, this is war - what are we waiting for?;Why don't we break the rules already?;I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white;I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,, but here they come again to jack my style;And that's alright,; I found a martyr in my bed tonight;She stops my bones from wondering just who I am,, who I am,, who I am;Oh,, who am I? Oh,, who am I?;;[Hook];Some nights,, I wish that this all would end;Cause I could use some friends for a change;And some nights,, I'm scared you'll forget me again;Some nights,, I always win;But I still wake up,, I still see your ghost;Oh Lord,, I'm still not sure what I stand for;What do I stand for? What do I stand for?;Most nights,, I don't know...;;[Bridge];So this is it? I sold my soul for this?;Washed my hands of that for this?;I miss my mom and dad for this?;No. When I see stars,, when I see stars,, that's all they are;When I hear songs,, they sound like a swan,, so come on;Oh,, come on. Oh,, come on!;;[Verse 2];That is it,, guys,, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again;Ten years of this,, I'm not sure if anybody understands;This one is not for the folks back home,; I'm sorry to leave,, mom,, I had to go;Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?;;[Verse 3];My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called love;And then I look into my nephew's eyes...;Man,, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...;Some terrible nights;;[Outro];The other night,, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me;I called you up,, but we'd both agree;It's for the best you didn't listen;It's for the best we get our distance...
