;[Verse 1];I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do;But if I let you go,, where you gonna go?;We gotta make a change,, time to turn the page;Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you;We've been through tougher times,, you know it gets worse;We can turn this around,, please let me be first;And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt;Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you;;[Hook];Hey you,, come over and let me embrace you;I know that I'm causing you pain too;But remember if you need to cry;I'm here to wipe your eyes;At night before you fall asleep;I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek);Cry cause I'm here to wipe your eyes;I know I made you feel this way;You gotta breathe,, we'll be okay (Be okay);Cry cause I'm here to wipe your eyes;;[Break];Cause I'm here to wipe your eyes;;[Verse 2];When did we cross the line,, how could we could forget;Why did we let the pressure get into our heads?;Your broken heart requires all of my attention;Cause something isn't right and I don't wanna fight ya;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Please don't loose your faith;Don't worry cause I'm here to keep you safe;I promise if you let me see your face;That I won't let you down,, I won't let you down;;I'm here to wipe your eyes;;[Hook]
