;[Verse 1];A couple of guys in first class on a flight;From New York to Los Angeles;Kinda making small talk killing time;Flirting with the flight attendants;Thirty-thousand feet above,, could be Oklahoma;;[Verse 2];Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms;Man,, it all looks the same;Miles and miles of back roads and highways;Connecting little towns with funny names;Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?;;[Verse 3];They've never drove through Indiana;Met the men who plowed that earth;Planted that seed,, busted his ass for you and me;Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas;They'd understand why god made;Those flyover states;;[Verse 4];I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all;Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul;Roads and rails under their feet;Yeah that sounds like a first class seat;;[Verse 5];On the plains of Oklahoma;With a windshield sunset in your eyes;Like a water-colored painted sky;;You'll think heaven's doors have opened;You'll understand why god made;Those flyover states;;[Verse 6];Take a ride across the badlands;Feel that freedom on your face;Breathe in all that open space;And meet a girl from Amarillo;You'll understand why god made;You might even wanna plant your stakes;In those flyover states;(Ya);;[Outro];Have you ever been through Indiana?;On the plains of Oklahoma?;Take a ride
