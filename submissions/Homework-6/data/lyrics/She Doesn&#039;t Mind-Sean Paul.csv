;When I was a kid;I used to think that pork chops and karate chops;Were the same thing;I thought they were both pork chops;And because my grandmother thought it was cute;And because they were my favourite;She let me keep doing it;;Not really a big deal;;One day;Before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees;I fell out of a tree;And bruised the right side of my body;;I didnt want to tell my grandmother about it;Because I was afraid Id get in trouble;For playing somewhere that I shouldnt have been;;A few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise;And I got sent to the principals office;From there I was sent to another small room;With a really nice lady;Who asked me all kinds of questions;About my life at home;;I saw no reason to lie;As far as I was concerned;Life was pretty good;I told her,, Whenever Im sad;My grandmother gives me karate chops;;This led to a full scale investigation;And I was removed from the house for three days;Until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises;;News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school;And I earned my first nickname;;Pork Chop;;To this day;I hate pork chops;;Im not the only kid;Who grew up this way;Surrounded by people who used to say;That rhyme about sticks and stones;As if broken bones;Hurt more than the names we got called;And we got called them all;So we grew up believing no one;Would ever fall in love with us;That wed be lonely forever;That wed never meet someone;To make us feel like the sun;Was something they built for us;In their tool shed;So broken heart strings bled the blues;As we tried to empty ourselves;So we would feel nothing;Dont tell me that hurts less than a broken bone;That an ingrown life;Is something surgeons can cut away;That theres no way for it to metastasize;;It does;;She was eight years old;Our first day of grade three;When she got called ugly;We both got moved to the back of the class;So we would stop get bombarded by spit balls;But the school halls were a battleground;Where we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day;We used to stay inside for recess;Because outside was worse;Outside wed have to rehearse running away;Or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there;In grade five they taped a sign to her desk;That read beware of dog;;To this day;Despite a loving husband;She doesnt think shes beautiful;Because of a birthmark;That takes up a little less than half of her face;Kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer;That someone tried to erase;But couldnt quite get the job done;And theyll never understand;That shes raising two kids;Whose definition of beauty;Begins with the word mom;Because they see her heart;Before they see her skin;Because shes only ever always been amazing;;He;Was a broken branch;Grafted onto a different family tree;Adopted;Not because his parents opted for a different destiny;He was three when he became a mixed drink;Of one part left alone;And two parts tragedy;Started therapy in 8th grade;Had a personality made up of tests and pills;Lived like the uphills were mountains;And the downhills were cliffs;Four fifths suicidal;A tidal wave of anti depressants;And an adolescence of being called popper;One part because of the pills;Ninety nine parts because of the cruelty;He tried to kill himself in grade ten;When a kid who could still go home to mom and dad;Had the audacity to tell him get over it as if depression;Is something that can be remedied;By any of the contents found in a first aid kit;;To this day;He is a stick of TNT lit from both ends;Could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends;In the moments before its about to fall;And despite an army of friends;Who all call him an inspiration;He remains a conversation piece between people;Who cant understand;Sometimes becoming drug free;Has less to do with addiction;And more to do with sanity;;We werent the only kids who grew up this way;To this day;Kids are still being called names;The classics were;Hey stupid;Hey spaz;Seems like each school has an arsenal of names;Getting updated every year;And if a kid breaks in a school;And no one around chooses to hear;Do they make a sound?;Are they just the background noise;Of a soundtrack stuck on repeat;When people say things like;Kids can be cruel?;Every school was a big top circus tent;And the pecking order went;From acrobats to lion tamers;From clowns to carnies;All of these were miles ahead of who we were;We were freaks;Lobster claw boys and bearded ladies;Oddities;Juggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle;Trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal;But at night;While the others slept;We kept walking the tightrope;It was practice;And yes;Some of us fell;;But I want to tell them;That all of this shit;Is just debris;Leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought;We used to be;And if you cant see anything beautiful about yourself;Get a better mirror;Look a little closer;Stare a little longer;Because theres something inside you;That made you keep trying;Despite everyone who told you to quit;You built a cast around your broken heart;And signed it yourself;You signed it;They were wrong;Because maybe you didnt belong to a group or a clique;Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything;Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth;To show and tell but never told;Because how can you hold your ground;If everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it;You have to believe that they were wrong;;They have to be wrong;;Why else would we still be here?;We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog;Because we see ourselves in them;We stem from a root planted in the belief;That we are not what we were called;We are not abandoned cars stalled out and;Sitting empty on a highway;And if in some way we are;Dont worry;We only got out to walk and get gas;We are graduating members from the class of Fuck Off We Made It;Not the faded echoes of voices crying out;Names will never hurt me;;Of course;They did;;But our lives will only ever always;Continue to be;A balancing act;That has less to do with pain;And more to do with beauty
