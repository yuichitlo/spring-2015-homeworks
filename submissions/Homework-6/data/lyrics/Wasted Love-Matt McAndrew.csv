;[Intro];Ooh,, wasted love;;[Verse 1];So I'm not supposed to love you no more;I guess I'm not supposed to care;I held you so close,, now I'm holding a ghost;How can love just disappear?;And where does it go when it's over?;I know that it's somewhere out here;;[Chorus 1];Has anybody seen all my wasted love?;I've been down every street,, no,, I won't give up;If I have to die trying to justify,, that's how it's gonna be;Has anybody seen all my wasted love?;;[Verse 2];It's late,, I'm drunk and I'm running on empty tonight;Baby,, I'm chasing my shadow around;Like smoke cigarettes I inhale these regrets;I can't change what I've become;There's pain and there's glory,, but this is my story;I'm asking everyone;Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement;Lie at your mercy,, will somebody save me? Save me?;;[Chorus 2];Has anybody seen all my wasted love?;I've been down every street,, no,, I won't give up;If I have to die let me testify,, that's how it's gonna be;Has anybody seen all my wasted love?;;[Outro];Bring it back to me,, all my wasted love
