;[Verse 1];They say we are what we are;But we dont have to be;Im bad behavior but I do it in the best way;Ill be the watcher of the eternal flame;Ill be the guard dog of all your fever dreams;;[Pre-Chorus];I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass,, glass);Ill try to picture me without you but I cant;;[Chorus];Cause we could be immortals,, immortals;Just not for long,, for long;Live with me forever now,, pull the blackout curtains down;Just not for long,, for long;We could be immortals;Immortals;;[Verse 2];Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith;Is when its tested again and again everyday;Im still comparing your past to my future;It might be your wound,, but theyre my sutures;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Outro];And if we meet forever now,, pull the blackout curtains down;We could be immortals,, immortals;Just not for long,, for long;We could be immortals;Immortals
