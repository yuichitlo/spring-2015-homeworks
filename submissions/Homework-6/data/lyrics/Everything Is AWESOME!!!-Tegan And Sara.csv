;[Chorus: Tegan and Sara];Everything is awesome;Everything is cool when you're part of a team;Everything is awesome;When youre living out a dream;;[Bridge: Tegan and Sara];Everything is better when we stick together;Side by side you and I are gonna win forever;Let's party forever;Were the same,, Im like you,, you're like me;We are working in harmony;;[Chorus: Tegan and Sara];;[Verse 1: The Lonely Island];Woooo! 3,, 2,, 1,, go!;Have you heard the news? Everyones talkin';Life is good cause everything's awesome;Lost my job,, theres a new opportunity;More free time for my awesome community;I feel more awesome than an awesome possum;Dip my body in chocolate frostin';Three years later wash off the frostin';Smellin like a blossom,, everything is awesome;Stepped in mud,, got new brown shoes;Its awesome to win and its awesome to lose;;[Bridge: Tegan and Sara];;[Chorus: Tegan and Sara];;[Verse 2: The Lonely Island];Blue skies,, bouncy springs;We just named two awesome things;A Nobel prize,, a piece of string;You know whats awesome? Everything!;Dogs with fleas,, allergies;A book of Greek antiquities;Brand new pants,, a very old vest;Awesome items are the best;Trees,, frogs,, clogs,, theyre awesome;Rocks,, clocks,, and socks,, theyre awesome;Figs,, and jigs,, and twigs,, thats awesome;Everything you see or think or say is awesome;;[Chorus: Tegan and Sara]
