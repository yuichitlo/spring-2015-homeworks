;Put on your war paint;;[Verse 1];You are a brick tied to me thats dragging me down;Strike a match and Ill burn you to the ground;We are the jack-o-lanterns in July;Setting fire to the sky;Here,, here comes this rising tide so come on;Put on your war paint;Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die;Silver Clouds with grey lining;;[Pre-Chorus];So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked;One maniac at a time we will take it back;You know time crawls on when youre;Waiting for the song to start;So dance alone to the beat of your heart;;[Chorus];Hey,, Youngblood doesnt it feel like our time is running out;Im going to change you like a remix;Then Ill raise you like a phoenix;Wearing our vintage misery;No I think it looked a little better on me;Im going to change you like a remix;Then Ill raise you like a phoenix;;[Verse 2];Bring home the boys in scraps;Scrap metal the tanks;Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks;Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks;You broke our spirit,, says the note we pass;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus][x2];;Put on your war paint;;[Bridge x4];The war is won before its begun;Release the doves;Surrender love;;[Chorus][x2]
