;[Produced by Key Wayne];[Directed by Jay Ahn];;[Verse 1];Is it strange for me to say that;If I were to die today;There's not a thing that I would change;I've lived well;Maybe I have made mistakes and been through my fair share of pain;But all in all,, it's been okay,, I've lived well;;[Pre-Hook];And the more that I see,, the more that I know;I don't know anything,, at all;Like the more that I breathe,, and start to go slow;Of all the many things,, I can only recall;;[Hook] (x2);All of the good things,, good things;All of the good things,, good things;Only the good,, the good,, the good;Only the good,, the good,, the good;;[Verse 2];Living on Sycamore street,, and spending weekends on the beach;We were free,, to be everything we dreamed;Flying kites and water fights;Summer nights,, we'd ride our bikes;On Overhill,, Ladara Heights;Man I swear;;[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x3)
