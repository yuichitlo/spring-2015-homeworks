;[Verse 1];And I came home;Like a stone;And I fell heavy into your arms;These days of dust;Which we've known;Will blow away with this new sun;;[Bridge];And I'll kneel down;Wait for now;And I'll kneel down;Know my ground;;[Hook];And I will wait,, I will wait for you;And I will wait,, I will wait for you;;[Verse 2];So break my step;And relent;You forgave and I won't forget;Know what we've seen;And him with less;Now in some way;Shake the excess;;[Hook x2];;[Verse 3];So I'll be bold;As well as strong;And use my head alongside my heart;So take my flesh;And fix my eyes;That tethered mind free from the lies;;[Bridge];But I'll kneel down;Wait for now;I'll kneel down;Know my ground;Raise my hands;Paint my spirit gold;And bow my head;Keep my heart slow;;[Hook x2]
