;[Verse 1];Know I've done wrong;I left your heart torn;Is that what devils do?;Took you so low;Where only fools go;I shook the angel in you;;[Pre-Chorus];Now I'm rising from the ground;Rising up to you;Filled with all the strength I found;There's nothing I cant do;;[Chorus];I need to know now,, know now;Can you love me again?;I need to know now,, know now;Can you love me again?;I need to know now,, know now;Can you love me again?;I need to know now,, know now;Can you love me again?;Can you love me again?;;[Verse 2];It's unforgivable;I stole and burnt your soul;Is that what demons do?;They rule the worst of me;Destroy everything;They bring down angels like you;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];I told you once again;Do this again,, do this again oh lord;I told you once again;Do this again,, do this again oh no;;[Chorus]
