;Title: Cornered;;*Breath goes across the screen. Two men sit in the back of a refrigerated truck. The truck comes to a stop. Outside we hear someone get out of a car and the driver get shot. Some mechanical noises as the exhaust is sent into the back of the truck. Gaff reaches over and grabs a cooler from the front seat then opens it and takes out the food inside. Inside the truck the two men struggle to get out to escape the exhaust fumes. Gaff and his two henchmen watch as the men in the truck slowly die. After a while Gaff and his two henchmen enter the truck and scan the buckets of chicken for one with a star on it. They take the bucket and leave the truck*;;Walt: *on answering machine* Uh,, it's me. I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids and uh,, I love you.;;*Skyler replays the message*;;Walt: *on answering machine* Uh,, it's me. I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids and uh...;;*Skyler puts a cup of coffee down on the nightstand next to Walt who is passed out. He wakes up*;;Walt: Morning.;;Skyler: Afternoon.;;Walt: Oh,, really? Jesus. You shouldn't have let me sleep.;;Skyler: You needed it.;;Walt: *sighs* *laughs* Skyler,, I don't entirely remember what happened last night. I may have said some things that...;;Skyler: Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?;;Walt: Skyler,, I can't even focus.;;Skyler: Gale Boetticher. Did you know him?;;Walt: Oh my God,, what...what exactly did I say last night?;;Skyler: Just enough. Did you work together?;;*Walt sighs*;;Skyler: Who killed him? Was it the people you work for?;;Walt: Definitely not.;;Skyler: Was it somebody who at some point might want to do the same to you?;;Walt: I seriously doubt it. No.;;*Walt sits up in bed*;;Walt: Oh God.;;Skyler: I think I know what happened last night,, Walt.;;Walt: I know exactly what happened last night: I drank too much wine.;;Skyler: You told Hank that the man he was looking for might still be out there. That it might not be this Boetticher after all. And I was up all night wondering why you would say that to him.;;Walt: Cause I was drunk,, Skyler.;;Skyler: No,, but then. But then I was remembering your black eye. Your,, uh,, business disagreement that you don't want to talk about?;;Walt: Look,, I don't want to talk about any of this,, ever. The firewall,, alright? Church and State,, that's how we need to approach this thing.;;Skyler: And then I remembered the message you left me the other day. When you said you loved me. When I heard that I thought that maybe,, you,, I don't know,, that you were regretting what's happened between us and I get that. After last night...Walt I think you're scared. I think that message was some kind of goodbye.;;Walt: No,, Skyler.;;Skyler: I think last night was a cry for help.;;Walt: Oh,, Jesus,, a cry for help.;;Skyler: I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.;;Walt: Wow! That is just. That is...that is it! Exactly,, yes! You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here,, God.;;Skyler: If he caught you at least this would all be over.;;Walt: Oh yeah,, this is a tremendous weight just lifted off me. Now I understand myself,, thank you. Thank you.;;Skyler: Walt,, I've said it before. If you are in danger we go to the police.;;Walt: Oh,, no,, I don't wanna hear about the police.;;Skyler: I do not say that lightly. I know what it could do to this family,, but if it's the only real choice we have. If it's either that or you getting shot when you open your front door-;;Walt: I don't want to hear about the police-;;Skyler: You're not some hardened criminal,, Walt. You are in over your head. That's what we tell them and that's the truth.;;Walt: No,, it's not the truth.;;Skyler: Of course it is. A school teacher,, cancer,, desperate for money?;;Walt: Okay,, we're done here.;;Skyler: Roped into working for -- unable to even quit! You told me that yourself Walt. Jesus,, what was I thinking? Walt,, please,, let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit that you're in danger.;;*Walt turns around quickly*;;Walt: Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean,, even if I told you,, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No,, you clearly don't know who you're talking to,, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger,, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!;;*Walt walks away into the bathroom,, leaving Skyler sitting on the bed. Walt takes a shower then goes back into the bedroom*;;Walt: Look,, I was...;;*Walt leaves the bedroom and walks through the house confused.*;;Walt: Skyler?;;*Walt looks outside to see Skyler's car gone*;;*The car wash door opens with Bogdan inside*;;Bogdan: Here we are. Just like you left it. And where is your pretty wife?;;Walt: She has other business to attend to.;;Bogdan: Well,, like I say to her,, place sells as is,, understand?;;Walt: Yes,, I understand.;;Bogdan: Good,, good. I don't want her coming back with more demands. She gave me hard time when we settled on price.;;Walt: We're all on the same page,, Bogdan.;;Bogdan: So,, here's everything you need. I keep very good files.;;*Bogdan hands Walt a stack of papers*;;Walt: Thank you.;;Bogdan: So you are the boss now,, huh? You think you're ready?;;Walt: Yes,, I...I think so.;;Bogdan: Being boss is tough. I know you think I was hard on you,, but you'll learn,, being in charge is not easy. It takes hard work.;;Walt: You've seen me work hard,, Bogdan.;;Bogdan: Yeah? I don't know. Not so much,, maybe. Maybe when you are the boss you will just keep your feet up and relax. The real important thing,, and not everyone knows this,, is to be tough. Boss has to be tough. Has to say no to people. Has to make cashiers wipe down cars,, even if they don't want to. Can you be tough,, Walter? *laughs* I'm sure you can handle. And if not,, you can always call your wife,, huh?;;*Walt slams his hand down on the cash register to open it*;;Bogdan: Always sticky,, no problem. As is.;;*Bogdan hands Walt the keys to the car wash*;;Bogdan: Who'd have thought that some day I would be handing these keys to you?;;*Bogdan moves a box then Walt moves it back*;;Bogdan: Many years. Almost forgot.;;*Bogdan takes down a dollar in a frame off the wall*;;Walt: Bogdan. As is.;;*Bogdan hands the framed dollar back to Walt then leaves the car wash. Walt breaks open the frame and takes out the dollar. He walks over to the soda machine and uses the dollar to buy a soda*;;*Mike and Jesse are sitting in a diner. Mike is reading a newspaper while eating some food,, Jesse has a cup of coffee*;;Mike: Thank you.;;Waitress: Mmhmm.;;*Jesse pours some sugar into his coffee then stirs it up. His hand is shaking*;;Mike: You okay there?;;Jesse: I'm fine. Just not,, not using is...;;*Mike slides his plate of food across the table to Jesse*;;Mike: Eat something.;;*Jesse takes a fork and eats some of Mike's food. Mike's phone vibrates*;;Mike: Yeah? That's right,, both of 'em. I'm on my way.;;*Mike gets up from the table*;;Jesse: You need any help?;;*Mike places money on the table*;;Mike: No.;;*Mike leaves the diner*;;*Walt and Junior are eating breakfast together*;;Junior: You want me to call her back?;;Walt: Eh,, no. What exactly did she say? Exactly.;;Junior: Just,, you know,, she asked if I was okay and not to worry. Like that.;;Walt: Hmm. Any,, uh,, rough time table on this thing,, as to when she's coming home?;;*Junior shakes his head no*;;Junior: It's about the gambling,, right?;;Walt: Well,, it's-it's kind of hard to.;;Junior: She can't understand. It's not like you're doing this on purpose,, you can't help it.;;Walt: It's not that simple.;;Junior: Look,, you have a disease. It's like you're an alcoholic,, right?;;Walt: No,, it's not like that at all.;;Junior: Yes it is,, I read online. She's not even allowed to be mad at you. And she can't be mad at you about the cancer,, can she?;;Walt: Son,, son. These are two very different things.;;Junior: Not really. Gambling addiction is a sickness,, you can't-;;Walt: Listen. What is going on with me is not about some disease,, it's about choices. Choices that I have made. Choices I stand by.;;*Walt and Junior are driving in Walt's car*;;Junior: You're not moving back in,, are you?;;Walt: No. Hey,, you know what? School can wait. Why don't we take a little detour?;;Junior: What kind of detour?;;Walt: You'll see.;;*Walt pulls up to a dealership*;;Walt: I think it's time you got you your own car,, what do you think?;;*Junior laughs*;;Walt: What?;;Junior: I think if you're gonna buy me off...buy me off.;;*Junior looks at a billboard of a Mustang*;;*Junior pulls into the driveway in a new red Mustang listening to music loudly*;;Walt: Wow.;;Junior: Amazing. It's amazing.;;Walt: Yeah,, it's good lookin'. Good,, I'm glad you like it.;;Junior: I do,, thank you dad.;;Walt: Alright,, you're welcome.;;*Jesse is leaning on his car smoking a cigarette as Walt pulls up to the laundromat*;;Walt: So you're here?;;Jesse: Yeah.;;Walt: You're actually here to work?;;Jesse: Yeah,, man. Jesus.;;Walt: Jesse. Come here.;;*Walt and Jesse walk behind a truck where they can't be seen/heard*;;Walt: Alright,, I need an update.;;Jesse: An update on what?;;Walt: An update on these little field trips you've been taking with Mike.;;Jesse: I told you already,, we pick up money,, check on things. Stuff like that.;;Walt: And you're his bodyguard right? Well what? That's what you said.;;Jesse: I said I guarded him. Like backup. Like a second set of eyes. Everybody needs backup,, right?;;Walt: And this has to be you? It can't be,, I don't know,, Tyrus or any of the couple thousand muscleheads that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman. Why? What is there something about you that I don't know? Are you a former Navy Seal? Do you have to have your registered as lethal weapons?;;Jesse: Register this.;;*Jesse flips Walt off*;;Walt: All I'm saying is that,, do you not even question this? Do you really believe you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.;;Jesse: I see they can't outright kill me,, but they don't want me getting high. I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me. But you know what? I saved Mike from getting robbed. Even killed,, maybe. So maybe I'm not such a loser after all!;;Walt: I mean what if it...oh God. I mean what if it,, what if it's all just a setup?;;Jesse: What?;;Walt: What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real? I mean,, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike. He steps out for one second and what happens? You immediately get robbed.;;Jesse: You're such an asshole.;;Walt: Keep your friends close,, keep your enemies closer. Like you said,, Gus can't kill you because of me. He knows I won't stand for it. He needs me and he hates the fact that he needs me so what does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me.;;Jesse: You're an asshole. If you'd been there,, you'd know it wasn't a setup.;;Walt: Wait a minute. How long did those guys chase you? Huh? Because the way you describe it they gave up pretty damn easy. No,, no,, this...this whole thing. All of this! It's all about me.;;*Jesse looks at him in disbelief then walks away,, Walt follows. They both go into the laundromat. Walt stops for a second to look into the camera outside*;;*Walt and Jesse are getting ready to leave after a cook. The phone rings*;;Walt: Hello. Uh,, look just,, hang on.;;*Walt walks over to Jesse and gives him the phone*;;Jesse: Yeah.I'll be right up.;;*Jesse hands the phone back to Walt and continues leaving*;;Walt: What?;;Jesse: I gotta go.;;Walt: Wha-am I supposed to clean all this on my own?;;*Jesse leaves*;;Walt: Hey! God.;;*Walt takes off his shoes and leaves the lab. Upstairs he finds a few of the laundromat workers*;;Walt: Ah. Buenos dias ladies! Buenos dias. Do you speak English? Habla ingles?;;All 3 women: No.;;Walt: Okay. Yo,, uh,, help help...ayunda?;;Worker 1: Ayuda.;;Walt: Ayuda,, ayuda! Gracias,, gracias. Yo neccisita,, neccisito ayuda a limpio. Si? Si? I need help to clean.;;Worker 1: Que?;;Walt: Yes,, si,, comprende? No no no no,, es bueno. Uh,, por favor,, por favor,, entrar. Entrar. Si. Muy bueno,, muy bueno. Yes muy bueno.;;*Walt walks the three women over to the entrance of the lab*;;Walt: It's just this-;;Worker 2: No. No no no no. Lo ciento.;;Walt: No no no no,, it's no problemo. Un momento,, un momento,, un momento.;;Worker 2: Ay no,, ay no. Podemos?;;Worker 1: No. No podemos carrer estadas trabar.;;Walt: No no,, ladies. Un momento,, un momento. Un momento. Yo necessito ayuda a limpio dos horas maximo. That's it. Muy facil.;;*The workers debate amongst themselves in spanish*;;Walt: I'll tell you what,, I'll tell you what. Universal language,, dinero.;;Woker 2: No.;;Walt: Si si si,, por usted. Si.;;*Walt hands them money*;;Walt: It's one for you. Yes,, si. Presidente Grant,, very important man. Pero usted,, si. And mas dinero,, mas dinero after the-;;*The workers debate amongst themselves in spanish again*;;Walt: Are we good? I think we're good. I think we listen to you. Please,, por favor,, por favor. Dos horas maximo. Please,, por favor,, por favor. Ah! Yes! [?];;*The women clean dressed in the orange jumpsuits as Walt drinks coffee. He raises his cup to the cameras watching them in the lab*;;*Skyler is driving down a long stretch with Holly in the back. She takes Holly out of the car and walks to the 4 corner monument. She takes out a coin flicks it into the air. It lands in Colorado. She picks it up and flicks it into the air again. it lands in Colorado again. She looks down at Holly then moves the coin to New Mexico with her foot*;;*Mike and Jesse are sitting in a car*;;Jesse: What's the deal?;;Mike: Well,, the deal is we're watching that house. Couple down on the left with the tree in the front?;;Jesse: Yeah? What for?;;Mike: Well a little birdy told me there's some guys in there that have 3 pounds of our product,, which they're selling. And which they sure as hell didn't get from us.;;Jesse: So,, what's the plan?;;Mike: I just told you. We sit here and watch that house. Until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out,, then we ask a few questions and get our property back.;;Jesse: Why don't you just go break the door down,, pistol whip those bitches and show 'em who's boss?;;Mike: Because a little birdy also told me these guys are heavily into the product and most likely armed. And what you may not know about meth heads,, or maybe you do,, they're kind of unpredictable. I don't care for unpredictable,, so we wait. Sorry to burst your bubble kid,, but that's 90% of the job. Don't worry,, I brought sandwiches. Yes sir. Uhh,, pimeno cheese? How's that sound?;;*Jesse puts his hand up to decline the sandwich. He gets out of the car*;;Mike: Woah woah woah,, where do you think you're going?;;Jesse: You said they're sellin',, right? Maybe I'm lookin' to buy.;;*Jesse knocks on the gate outside their door. Tucker answers*;;Tucker: Who the hell are you?;;Scary Skell: Tucker!;;Jesse: I'm here to buy.;;Tucker: Not my question.;;Scary Skell: Tucker why'd you answer the door? Tucker! Tucker!;;Jesse: My name's Diesel. Heard you maybe had some of the blue?;;Scary Skell: Tucker! Shut the door Tucker!;;Jesse: I'm just lookin' for a teenth,, yo,, come on. Help a brother out.;;Scary Skell: Tucker! Tucker will you shut the damn door?!;;Tucker: We don't sell to strangers. Get off the porch asshole.;;Scary Skell: Tucker! Tucker will you shut the door?;;Tucker: Alright already,, Jesus!;;*Tucker slams toe door on Jesse. Jesse walks back to the car and gets in*;;Mike: Guess we'll go with plan A then.;;Jesse: Pop the trunk,, would ya?;;Mike: Why?;;Jesse: There's something in there I need.;;Mike: And what would that be?;;Jesse: I'm getting those pricks out of that house.;;Mike: Oh with your first attempt being such a wild success.;;Jesse: You may know this whole P.I. sit in the car business,, but I know meth heads.;;*Jesse goes into the truck and takes out a shovel. He walks over to the house and starts digging in the front yard. Tucker walks out of the house slowly toward Jesse*;;Tucker: What are you doing?;;Jesse: Digging.;;Tucker: Why?;;Jesse: Oh,, you know why.;;Tucker: How deep are you going?;;Jesse: I don't know,, how deep do you think it is?;;Tucker: Pretty deep.;;Jesse: Hey uh,, you mind taking over for a minute?;;Tucker: Yeah,, sure.;;*Tucker takes the shovel from Jesse and starts digging*;;Jesse: Hey,, uh,, mind if I use your John?;;Tucker: Yeah.;;*Mike smiles as he watches Jesse enter the house*;;Scary Skell: Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Who the hell are you?;;Jesse: Alright,, hey,, it's cool. I'm a,, I'm a friend of Tucker's.;;Scary Skell: What do you want?;;Jesse: I just,, uh,, I just wanna buy some of the blue.;;Scary Skell: It's not for sale.;;Jesse: Well I know that you were selling it earlier,, so-;;Scary Skell: Oh yeah,, how do you know that?;;Jesse: Uh,, Tucker told me.;;Scary Skell: Yeah well,, Tucker needs to learn to keep his damn mouth shut. Tucker! Tucker!;;Jesse: So uh,, you gonna hook me up?;;Scary Skell: Don't have enough for all of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!;;Jesse: You know I think he's outside. You wanna just go outside?;;Scary Skell: Tucker! Tucker!;;Jesse: Hey,, hey. Let's go find Tucker. Okay? Let's go outside and-;;*Scary Skell walks toward Jesse quickly with his shotgun aimed at him*;;Scary Skell: I don't have enough for you. Alright?;;Jesse: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey,, okay. I don't wanna start any trouble-;;Scary Skell: Trouble? Trouble,, what does that mean,, trouble?;;Jesse: No no no,, I'm just sayin',, we're cool. Okay,, we're good.;;Scary Skell: What? You can't know that. What does that mean? What? You don't put thoughts in my head. You don't put thoughts in my head!;;Jesse: Absolutely,, you're right. You're right.;;*The backdoor opens in the background*;;Scary Skell: Tucker?;;*Jesse knocks Scary Skell out with a bong. Jesse takes the shotgun from him while he lays on the ground. Mike walks into the house and looks on the bucket. He puts the top of the bucket down. Tucker is still digging outside the house*;;Walt: Muchos gracias amigas. Muchos gracias.;;*Walt hands the workers more money*;;Walt: There you go,, Maria.;;Maria: Oh,, gracias.;;Walt: Frederico.;;Worker 1: Muchos gracias.;;Walt: Si,, there you go.

Now mas-;;*Tyrus is standing in front of Walt and the workers*;;Tyrus: *to workers* Vengan conmigo.;;*The workers argue with Tyrus,, but he doesn't budge. He tells them to follow him*;;Walt: Wait a minute,, where are you taking them? Come on Tyrus,, what are you doing?;;Tyrus: I'm putting them on a bus.;;Walt: Why? What bus?;;Tyrus: One that takes them back to Honduras.;;Walt: Hey,, wait a second. Wait a minute. This was my idea,, don't punish them. You tell Gus to blame me,, not them.;;Tyrus: He does.;;*Tyurs walks away with the workers*;;*Mike and Jesse are back at the diner,, both eating. Gus walks in*;;Mike: *to Jesse* Give us a minute,, will ya?;;*Jesse looks back and sees Gus. He gets up to leave*;;Gus: *to Jesse* We won't be too long.;;*Gus sits down as Jesse steps outside*;;Mike: The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple local nobodies. And very disciplined of not keeping any for themselves. It was all about sending a message. Which they did,, literally. It was written on the bucket lid. Ready to talk? That I believe was the English translation. I know you're not really asking for advice,, but let me hire 10,, 15 more good operators and we hit 'em back,, hit 'em hard,, hit 'em where they live.;;Gus: No. This war stays cold for now.;;Mike: What about their message? What's the answer?;;Gus: *sighs* Set up a meeting,, let's see what they have to say. How did he do today?;;*Jesse paces outside. Gus gets up and leaves the diner*;;Gus: I hear you can handle yourself.;;Jesse: I guess.;;Gus: Goodnight.;;Jesse: Hey,, excuse me. Why me?;;Gus: I like to think I see things in people.;;*Gus walks away and gets in his car then drives away*;;*Skyler pulls up to the White residence and sees the new Mustang Walt bought*;;Walt: *to Junior* Slow down. The car's not going anywhere.;;*Skyler enters the house with Holly. Junior and Walt get up*;;Junior: Mom!;;Skyler: Hey,, sweetheart. Hi.;;Junior: Hey.;;Skyler. Whew. Ah,, there ya go.;;Junior: So,, did you see what's in the driveway?;;Skyler: Uhh,, yeah I saw. Hey. *kisses Junior on the cheek* So that's yours,, huh?;;Junior: Yeah,, dad got it for me.;;Skyler: Well that was very nice of him.;;Junior: Yeah. I know it looks like...well...awesome,, but it's super safe. Dad made sure. And I promise to always go the speed limit,, or below. Way below. And it gets great gas mileage. So,, dad said I could take it around the block a few times,, is that okay? Just around the block.;;Skyler: Yeah,, just around the block. And be careful,, okay?;;Junior: I will.;;*Skyler kisses Junior on the cheek.;;Junior: It's really great to have you home,, mom.;;Walt: *to Junior* Hey,, seriously be careful. Okay?;;Junior: I know.;;*Walt walks over to Skyler who is cleaning the table*;;Walt: I guess we should talk.;;Skyler: Well,, I think you said plenty the other day.;;Walt: Look,, about that...it just...;;Skyler: Did you get the carwash keys?;;Walt: Um,, yes. Yes.;;*Walt hands the keys to Skyler*;;Walt: Skyler. I may have overstated things earlier. And I'm sorry to be so,, forward,, but I just want you to know something. I want you to -- I need you to understand that you are safe. You,, Junior,, Holly. You are completely safe. Everything that I do,, everything. I do it to protect this family.;;Skyler: So buying that car,, that was protecting your family?;;Walt: Okay. Alright maybe it's a little flashy,, but he needed a car. And I'm his father I should be able to get what he wants.;;Skyler: It goes back. Tomorrow.;;Walt: Skyler,, it will crush him.;;Skyler: That car directly contradicts our story and if you're so invested in protecting this family,, it means protecting this story. What do you think the neighbors will say Walt? What about Hank and Marie? How about the IRS? What were you thinking,, Walt?;;Walt: I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son. Look,, I just worry that he'll blame you for this.;;Skyler: Oh he will. Once again,, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him,, so...thanks for that. But you know what,, Walt? Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.;;*Skyler takes Holly to her room*
