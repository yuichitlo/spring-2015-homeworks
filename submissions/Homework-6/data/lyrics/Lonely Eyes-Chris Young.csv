;Tuesday night crowded bar;Some guy lights a cheap cigar;Bartender yells at him;So he walks out and you walk in;Right through then cloud of smoke;Catcalls and dirty jokes;Scan the room a couple times;Find a seat right next to mine;;[Chorus:];Lonely eyes;Well,, it sure looks like;You just might;Be looking for something;For something,, whoa;Look at me;And I think You'll see;Those Lonely Eyes;Don't have to be alone tonight;;They analyze your glass of wine;Roll away a pickup line;Now and then they check your phone;Catch mine and let 'em go;From the little bit I've seen;They're the perfect shade of green;Next time they come my way;Heaven help me make 'em stay;;[Chorus];;Don't make me pay my tab;Catch a cab;Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight;Gimme a sign;Just a smile;Baby,, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside;;Lonely eyes;Lonely eyes;Sure looks like;You just might;Be Looking for something;For something,, whoa;Look at me;And I'll think you'll see;Those lonely eyes;They don't have to be alone tonight;Lonely Eyes,, you don't have to be alone tonight
