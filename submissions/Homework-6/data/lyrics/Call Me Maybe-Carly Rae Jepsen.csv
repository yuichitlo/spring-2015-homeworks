;[Verse 1];I threw a wish in the well;Don't ask me,, I'll never tell;I looked to you as it fell;And now you're in my way;I'd trade my soul for a wish;Pennies and dimes for a kiss;I wasn't looking for this;But now you're in my way;;[Pre-Hook];Your stare was holding;Ripped jeans,, skin was showing;Hot night,, wind was blowing;Where you think you're going,, baby?;;[Hook];Hey,, I just met you,, and this is crazy;But here's my number,, so call me maybe;It's hard to look right at you baby;So here's my number,, so call me maybe;Hey,, I just met you,, and this is crazy;But here's my number,, so call me maybe;All the other boys try to chase me;So here's my number,, so call me maybe;;[Verse 2];You took your time with the call;I took no time with the fall;You gave me nothing at all;But still you're in my way!;I beg,, borrow,, and steal;At first sight and it's real;I didn't know I would feel it;But it's in my way;;[Pre-Hook];Your stare was holding,, ripped jeans;Skin was showing;Hot night,, wind was blowing;Where you think you're going baby?;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Before you came into my life,, I missed you so bad;I wish you know that I missed you so so bad;;[Hook]
