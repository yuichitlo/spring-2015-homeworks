;[Verse 1];I hate that I remember;I wish I could forget;What you did last December;You left my heart a mess (A mess);Boy,, you blew it;How could you do it? (do it);;[Chorus] x2;Last Christmas;I gave you my heart;But the very next day you gave it away;This year;To save me from tears;I'll give it to someone special;;[Verse 2];Thought we belong together;At least that's what you said;I should have known better;You broke my heart again;Boy,, you blew it;How could you do it?;;[Chorus] x2;;[Verse 3];How could you leave Christmas morning?;You broke my heart with no warning;Boy,, you blew it;How could you do it? (do it);;[Chorus];;[Outro];This is our Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas;You broke my heart;Last (Last) Last (Last) Christmas;You broke my heart;This year;To save me from tears;I'll give it to someone special;;I hate that I remember;I wish I could forget;What you did last December;You left my heart a mess (A mess);Boy,, you blew it;How could you do it? (do it)
