;[Intro];I like us better when we're wasted;It makes it easier to fake it;The only time we really talk;Is when our clothes are coming off;I like us better when we're wasted;It makes it easier to say it;Lay all your laundry on the bed;And then I'll lay it in instead;I like us better when we're wasted;;Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh;;[Verse 1];You are my glass half empty;Sipping my ocean dry;Emotionally spin me;'Till none of our planets could align;But I could stand you one more night;;[Chorus];I like us better when we're wasted;It makes it easier to say it;Lay all your laundry on the bed;And then I'll lay in it instead;I like us better when we're wasted;;Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh;;[Verse 2];You are a catch-22,, either way I miss out;All of the grief I give you;Is energy I can live without;But I could stand you one more night;;[Chorus];;Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh;;[Chorus];;Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh
