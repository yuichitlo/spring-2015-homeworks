;[Verse 1];When life leaves you high and dry;I'll be at your door tonight;If you need help,, if you need help;I'll shut down the city lights;I'll lie,, cheat,, I'll beg and bribe;To make you well,, to make you well;[Verse 2];When enemies are at your door;I'll carry you away from war;If you need help,, if you need help;Your hope dangling by a string;I'll share in your suffering;To make you well,, to make you well;;[Bridge];Give me reasons to believe;That you would do the same for me;[Hook];And I would do it for you,, for you;Baby,, I'm not moving on;I love you long after you're gone;For you,, for you;You would never sleep alone;I love you long after you're gone;And long after you're gone,, gone,, gone;;[Verse 3];When you fall like a statue;I'm gon' be there to catch you;Put you on your feet,, you on your feet;And if your well is empty;Not a thing will prevent me;Tell me what you need,, what do you need;;[Bridge];I surrender honestly;You've always done the same for me;;[Hook];;[Interlude];You're my back bone;You're my cornerstone;You're my crutch when my legs stop moving;You're my head start;You're my rugged heart;You're the pulse that I've always needed;Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum my heart never stops beating;;[Hook];;[Outro];Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum,, baby,, don't stop beating;Like a drum my heart never stops beating for you;And long after you're gone,, gone,, gone;I love you long after you're gone gone,, gone
