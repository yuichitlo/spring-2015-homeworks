;[Hook: Liz Rodrigues];This is survival of the fittest;This is do or die;This is the winner takes it all;So take it all,, a-all,, a-all,, a-all;;[Verse 1];Wasn't ready to be no millionaire,, I was ill-prepared;I was prepared to be ill though,, the skill was there;From the beginning,, it wasn't 'bout the ends;It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something  fuckin' acronym;Cut the fucking act like you're happy,, I'm fucking back again;With another anthem,, why stop when it doesn't have to end;It ain't over 'til I say it's over  enough when I say enough;Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up;I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves,, when the thought;Of being thrown into an alligator pit,, I salivate at it,, wait is up;Hands up like it's 12 noon,, nah homie,, hold them bitches straighter up;Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff,, came up rough;Came to ruffle feathers,, nah,, egos,, I ain't deflate enough;Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause;;[Hook];;[Verse 2];I can see the finish line with each line that I finish;I'm so close to my goals,, I can almost pole vault over the goal post;And if I don't got enough in the tank,, maybe I can just siphon enough;To fill up this last can,, man will I survive in this climate or what?;They said I was washed up,, and got a blood bath;I'm not a rapper,, I'm an adapter  I can adjust;Plus,, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust;So,, floor's open if you'd like to discuss;Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut,, what?;Like I give a fuck but I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck;Through the side of a pump,, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it;Like G-Unit without the hyphen,, I'm hyping 'em up;And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut;And I look like I might just give up,, eh,, might've mistook;Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow,, I'm stabbing myself;With a fucking knife in the gut,, while I'm wiping my butt;Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut;I get excited at the sight of my blood,, you're in a fight with a nut;Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win,, biting the dust,, it'll just make me angrier;Wait,, let me remind you of what got me this far,, picture me quitting;Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it,, slut;It's survival of what?;;[Hook];;[Verse 3];So get your ideas,, stack your ammo;But don't come unless you come to battle,, now mount up,, jump in the saddle;This is it  it's what you eat,, sleep,, piss and shit;Live,, breathe,, your whole existence just consists of this;Refuse to quit,, fuse is lit,, can't defuse the wick;If I don't do this music shit,, I'll lose my shit;Ain't got shit to lose,, it's the moment of truth;It's all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in a booth,, I spit;But my respect is overdue,, I'm showing you the flow no one do;Cause I don't own no diploma for school,, I quit;So there's nothing for me to fall back on,, I know no other trade;So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es;Cause you'll never take my pride from me,, it'll have to be pried from me;So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers;But I want you to doubt me,, I don't want you to buh-lieve;Cause this is something that I must use to succeed;And if you don't like me then fuck you;Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me;My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me;I can see why the fuck I disgust you;I must be allergic to failure,, cause everytime I come close to it;I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then A-chieve!;;[Hook]
