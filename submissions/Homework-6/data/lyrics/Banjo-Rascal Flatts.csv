;[Verse 1: Gary];When I lose my smile;When my thoughts get jumbled;When the air and BS get too thick;Cant take a breath;Without getting sick;Ive had enough;With this concrete jungle;I drop my truck in drive;I pick up my baby;She jumps in with a kiss and a hey;We exit off that old highway;Sometimes you gotta go;Beyond the pavement;;[Chorus];You gotta go deep;Way on back;Cross a few creeks;And a couple little shacks;You gotta get lost;Way on out;Crickets and frogs;Yeah youre gettin close now;And you kick it into four wheel drive;When you run out of road;And you go,, and you go and you go-go-go;Til you hear a banjo;;[Verse 2: Gary];It aint on no map;And Im glad it isnt;Leave the phone;And the GPS;Those satellites;Aint found it yet;Got our own little;Piece of heaven hidden;;[Chorus x3]
