;[Verse 1];Let the bough break,, let it come down crashing;Let the sun fade out to a dark sky;I can't say I'd even notice it was absent;Cause I could live by the light in your eyes;I'll unfold before you;Would have strung together;The very first words;Of a lifelong love letter;;[Chorus];Tell the world that we finally got it all right;I choose you;I will become yours and you will become mine;I choose you [x2];(Yeah);;[Verse 2];There was a time when I would have believed them;If they told me you could not come true;Just love's illusion;But then you found me and everything changed;And I believe in something again;My whole heart;Will be yours forever;This is a beautiful start;To a lifelong love letter;;[Chorus];Tell the world that we finally got it all right;I choose you;I will become yours and you will become mine;I choose you [x2];;[Verse 3];We are not perfect;We'll learn from our mistakes;And as long as it takes;I will prove my love to you;I am not scared of the elements;I am under-prepared,, but I am willing;And even better;I get to be the other half of you;;[Chorus];Tell the world that we finally got it all right;I choose you;I will become yours and you will become mine;I choose you [x3]
