;[Verse 1];Shell lie and steal and cheat;And beg you from her knees;Make you think she means it this time;Shell tear a hole in you the one you cant repair;But i still love her;I dont really care;;[Bridge];When we were young,, oh oh we did enough;When it got cold,, ooh ooh we bundled up;I cant be told,, ah ah it cant be done;;[Verse 2];Its better to feel pain than nothing at all;The opposite of love is indifference;So pay attention now;Im standing on your porch screamin' out;And I wont leave until you come downstairs;;[Chorus];So keep your head up keep your love;So keep your head up,, my love;So keep your head up,, my love;So keep your head up keep your love;;[Verse 3];And I dont blame you;For running like you did all these years;I would do the same,, you best believe;And the highway signs say were close;But I dont read those things anymore;I never trusted my own eyes;;[Bridge];;[Chorus];;Head up,, love;Head up,, love;Head up,, love;Head up,, love
