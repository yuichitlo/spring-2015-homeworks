;[Hook];I got this feelin' on this summer day when you were gone;I crashed my car into the bridge,, I watched,, I let it burn;I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs;I crashed my car into the bridge,, I don't care!;I love it,, I don't care!;;[Verse 1];You're on a different road I'm in the Milky Way;You want me down on Earth,, but I am up in space;You're so damn hard to please,, we gotta kill this switch;You're from the seventies,, but I'm a nineties bitch;I love it! I love it!;;[Hook];;[Bridge];I love it,, I love it!;I don't care!
