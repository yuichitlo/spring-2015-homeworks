;[Verse 1];Some days it is tough just getting up;Throwing on these boots and making that climb;Some days I would rather be a no-show lay-low;Before I go out of my mind;;[Chorus];But when she says baby;Oh no matter what comes is not going nowhere she runs her fingers through my hair and saves me;Yeah that look in her eyes got me coming alive and driving me a good kind of crazy;When she says baby;Oh when she says baby;;[Verse 2];Some nights I come home fighting mad;Feel like running my fist through the wall;Is it even worth it what I am fighting for anymore feeling;Torn all the hell with it all;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Everything going to be alright;Just lay down by my side;Let me love you through this life;;Yeah she is the perfect shot of faith;When every bit of mine is gone;Something I can believe in a best friend;A heaven sent love to lean on;;[Chorus]
