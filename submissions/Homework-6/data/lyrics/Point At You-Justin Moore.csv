;[Verse 1];I've always been one of them boys;Rolling around in jacked up toys;Making noise on small town Friday nights;Red light running,, good time chasing;Guess I've earned this reputation;Probably never shake it but that's alright;;[Chorus];I've got a rough side,, a wild side;At least a country mile wide;A fighting side after a few;If they want to see my sweet side;My soft side,, my best side;I just point at you;Yea,, point at you;;[Verse 2];Girl I ain't sure just what it is;That's got me all tore up like this;Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone;I still like to get a little crazy;But something about your loving baby;It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me;Lord knows I'm hard to hold;But I guess you kinda like all of my sides;And I ain't letting you go;Cause my best side is holding me close;Point at you,, yeah;;[Chorus]
