;[Intro: Usher];If you live for somethin';You're not alone my friend;So fill up your cup and lift your lighter;A toast to life;;[Verse 1: Ludacris];They say what don't kill me can make me stronger;So two drinks a night should help me live longer;I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test;Because why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death;I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll;Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul;And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool;So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules;;[Hook: Usher];That's somewhere to gone,, but the world is moving slow;I was born for the fast life;I go for broke,, a lesson I can't afford;But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay;For the rest of my life;For the rest of my life;;[Break: Usher];Na na hey,, oh;Na na hey,, oh;Na na hey,, oh;Na na hey,, for the rest of my life;;[Verse 2: Ludacris];If I got one life to live,, I'mma party 'til I'm dead;What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge;Trying to keep my balance,, I'm twisted so just in case I fall;Written on my tombstone should say Women,, Weed,, and Alcohol;;[Hook];;[Break];;[Intro];;[Verse 3: Ludacris];I'm stuck in this moment,, freeze the hands of time;Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind;And you can call me crazy,, but I like to roll the dice;So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life;;[Outro: Usher];For the rest of my life;For the rest of my life
