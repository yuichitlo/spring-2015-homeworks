;[Verse 1];She's sick of this town,, she's sick of that boy;Yeah she's sick of dreams that never take flight;There's gotta be more than the same old story;So she's gonna turn the page tonight;And turn the radio up (turn the radio up);Roll the windows down;She got a full tank of gas (she got a full tank of gas);Ain't no stopping her now;;[Chorus];She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford;Yeah,, the only thing that's left to do;Is catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes;Are leaving nothing in that rearview;But dust,, nothing but dust;;[Verse 2];She's fighting back tears,, she's fighting back years;Of the only life she's ever known;There's a future that's bright in the dead of this night;And all she's gotta do is go;And turn the radio up (turn the radio up);Roll the windows down;She got an open road (she got an open road);Ain't no stopping her now;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];She got the radio up;She got the windows down;No she won't look back;Ain't no stopping her;Ain't no stopping her now...;;[Chorus]
