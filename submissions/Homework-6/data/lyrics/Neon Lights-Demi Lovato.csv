;[Chorus];Baby when they look up at the sky;We'll be shooting stars just passing by;You'll be coming home with me tonight;We'll be burning up like neon lights;;[Verse];Be still,, my heart,, cause it's freaking out,, it's freaking out,, right now;Shining like stars cause we're beautiful,, we're beautiful,, right now;You're all I see in all these places;You're all I see in all these faces;So let's pretend we're running out of time,, of time;;[Chorus](2x);;[Post-Chorus];(Neon lights);(Neon lights);(Neon lights);Like neon lights! Oh!;Like neon lights! Oh!;;[Verse];;[Chorus](2x);;[Post-Chorus];;[Bridge];Shining like stars cause we're beautiful,, beautiful;You're all I see in all these places;You're all I see in all these faces;So let's pretend we're running out of time,, of time!;;[Post-Chorus];Like neon lights! Oh!;Like neon lights! Oh!;;[Outro];Be still,, my heart,, cause it's freaking out
