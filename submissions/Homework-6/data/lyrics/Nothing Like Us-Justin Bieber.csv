;[Verse 1];Lately Ive been thinkin,, thinkin bout what we had;I know it was hard,, it was all that we knew,, yeah;Have you been drinkin,, to take all the pain away?;I wish that I could give you what you,, deserve;Cause nothing could ever,, ever replace you;Nothing can make me feel like you do;You know theres no one,, I can relate to;And know we wont find a love thats so true;;[Chorus];Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together through the storm;Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together;;[Verse 2];I gave you everything,, baby,, everything I had to give;Girl,, why would you push me away?;Lost in confusion,, like an illusion;You know Im used to making your day;But that is the past now,, we didnt last now;Guess that this is meant to be;Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect;But baby I just want you to see;;[Chorus];Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together through the storm;Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together;Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together through the storm;Theres nothing like us,, theres nothing like you and me;Together
