;[Verse 1];Thought you'd change the weather;Start a little storm;Make a little rain;But I'm going to do one better hide the sun until you pray;I'm a tornado looking for a soul to take;;You're going to see me coming by the selfish things that you did;I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit;I'm a tornado looking for a man to break;;Yeah,, I'm going to lift this house,, spin it all around;Toss it in the air and put it in the ground;Make sure you're never found;;Thought you'd take a swing;Try another girl,, try another night;But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life;I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5;;[Chorus];Hey,, I'm going to lift this house,, spin it all around;Toss it in the air and put it in the ground;I'm going to lift this house,, spin it all around;Toss it in the air and put it in the ground;Make sure you're never found,, oh,, yeah;;[Bridge];OOOOOOOOOOO;MMMMMMMMMM;;[Chorus];;[Verse 2];The winds are getting stronger;And the sky is falling through;And you aren't got much longer;Until the rage rips off the roof;I'm a tornado[?] and I'm coming after you[?];;[Bridge];Oooo...;Hmm...;Oooo...;;[Outro];(I'm going to lift this house,, spin it all around;Toss it in the air and put it in the ground)
