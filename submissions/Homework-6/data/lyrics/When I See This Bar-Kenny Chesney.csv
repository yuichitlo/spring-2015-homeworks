;[Verse 1];Well I see the souls of so many friends;And I see us all back here again;With sandy floors and ceiling fans;A Rastafarian one-man band with songs;That fills my memories like a tip jar;Yeah,, that's what I see;When I see this bar;;[Verse 2];I see tourists at Christmas time;And I taste beers with a hint of lime;I feel lonely because it's not the same;Different faces and different names;Living like pirates out among the stars;Yeah,, that's what I see;When I see this bar;;[Chorus];Pieces of our past slowly slip away;But time just stands still when I walk in this place;;[Verse 3];And I see a kid coming into his own;And a man learning to move on;Somehow trying to find his way;A dreamer betting on blind faith;Chasing that sun and following his heart;Yeah,, that's what I see;When I see this bar;;[Chorus];;[Verse 4];A few have moved on back to Maine;Jacksonville and Key Biscayne;Some are still living the dream;Stuck in still life it seems;No matter where they've been;Or where they are;Yeah,, I see them here;When I see this bar;When I see this bar;;[Verse 5];I wonder where we go from here;(That's what I see when I see this bar);Life isn't over but it's always near;(That's what I see when I see this bar);I think about all the good times that we had;(That's what I see when I see this bar);It makes me happy and it makes me sad;(That's what I see when I see this bar);How could we be so close,, now so far apart;(That's what I see when I see this bar);That's what I feel,, that's what I see;Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars;That's what I see when I see this bar;;[Chorus];That's what I see when I see this bar
