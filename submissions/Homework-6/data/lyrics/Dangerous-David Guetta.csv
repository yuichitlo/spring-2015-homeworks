;[Verse 1: Sam Martin];You take me down,, spin me around;You got me running all the lights;Don't make a sound,, talk to me now;Let me inside your mind;;[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin];I don't know what you're thinking sugar;But I just got that feeling sugar;I can hear the sirens burning;Red lights turning;I can't turn back now;So hold on tight;;[Chorus: Sam Martin];I don't know where the lights are taking us;But something in the night is dangerous;And nothing's holding back the two of us;Baby this is getting serious;Oh oh oh;Dangerous;Oh oh oh;;[Verse 2: Sam Martin];Show me your soul,, I gotta know;Bet that you're beautiful inside;Toes on the gas,, car moving fast;Come take the wheel and drive;;[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin];;[Chorus: Sam Martin];;[Bridge: Sam Martin];It's dangerous,, so dangerous;I wanna do it again;Come on baby;It's dangerous,, so dangerous;I wanna do it again;It's dangerous,, so dangerous;I wanna do it again;;[Chorus: Sam Martin]
