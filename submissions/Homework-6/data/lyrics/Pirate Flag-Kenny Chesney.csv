;[Verse 1];Well I come from a little bitty,, homegrown small town;Smoky Mountains,, nice place to hang around;Moonshine,, that's where they make it;Put it in a jug,, makes you want to get naked;But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night;And took it all the way to the end of the line;Stepped out in the sun,, when my feet hit the sand;What a long strange trip;;[Hook];I spent my whole life running around;Still let the wind kind of blow me around;Well I dropped a note in a bottle;To a long-legged model;And I traded it in for a whole another world;A pirate flag and an island girl;;[Verse 2];Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind;Take a sip of rum and you really would know why;Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table;Blender in the kitchen,, willing and able;Don't know what makes you say what the hell;But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail;Something about it makes her just want to dance;And she loves to dance;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon;Tucked back in the woods,, yeah life was good;But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars;;[Outro];I might spend my whole life running around;Still let the wind kind of blow me around;Well I dropped a note in a bottle;To a long-legged model;And I traded it in for a whole another world;A pirate flag and an island girl;A pirate flag and an island girl
