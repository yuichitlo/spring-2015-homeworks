;[Hook];Santa tell me,, if you're really there;Don't make me fall in love again;If he won't be here,, next year;Santa tell me,, if he really cares;Cause I can't give it all the way;If he won't be here,, next year;;[Chorus 1];Feeling Christmas all around;And I'm trying to play it cool;But it's hard to focus when I see him walking across the room;Let it snow is blasting now;But I won't get it in the mood;I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true;;[Pre-Hook];True love;That he thinks of;So next Christmas;I'm not all alone boy;;[Hook];;[Chorus 2];I've been down this road before;Fell in love on Christmas night;But on New Years Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side;Now I need someone to hold;Be my fire in the cold;But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love;;[Pre Hook];;[Hook];;[Chorus 3];Oh I wanna have him beside me like ooh-woo-ooh;On the 25th,, by the fireplace ooh-woo-ooh;But I don't want no broken heart;This year I gotta be smart;;[Hook] (x2)
