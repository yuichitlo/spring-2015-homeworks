;[Verse 1:];You know the bed feels warmer;Sleeping here alone;You know I dream in color;And do the things I want;;[Pre-Chorus 1:];You think you got the best of me;Think you've had the last laugh;Bet you think that everything good is gone;Think you left me broken down;Think that I'd come running back;Baby you don't know me,, cause you're dead wrong;;[Chorus,, part A:];What doesn't kill you makes you stronger;Stand a little taller;Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone;What doesn't kill you makes a fighter;Footsteps even lighter;Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone;;[Chorus,, part B:];What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,, stronger;Just me,, myself,, and I;What doesn't kill you makes you stronger;Stand a little taller;Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone;;[Verse 2:];You heard that I was starting over with someone new;They told you I was moving on,, over you;;[Pre-Chorus 2:];You didn't think that I'd come back;I'd come back swinging;You tried to break me,, but you see;;[Chorus,, parts A &amp,; B];;[Bridge:];Thanks to you I got a new thing started;Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted;Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me;You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning;In the end;;[Chorus,, parts A &amp,; B];;[Outro:];(When I'm alone)
