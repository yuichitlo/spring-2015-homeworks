;[Verse 1];All these kind of places;Make it seem like its been ages;And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky;I love this country dearly;I can feel the ladder clearly;But I never thought Id be alone to try;;Once I was outside Penn Station;Selling red and white carnations;We were still alone;My wife and I;Before we marry,, save my money;Brought my dear wife over;Now I work to bring my family state side;;But off the boat they stayed a while;Then scattered across the coast;Once a year Ill see them for a week or so;At most I took a walk;;[Hook];Take a walk,, take a walk,, take a walk;Take a walk,, Oh-oh-oh;I took a walk;Take a walk,, take a walk,, take a walk;Take a walk,, Oh-oh-oh;;[Verse 2];Practice isnt perfect;With the market cuts and loss;I remind myself that times could be much worse;My wife wont ask me questions;And there's not so much to ask;And shell never flaunt around an empty purse;;Once my mother-in-law came;Just to stay a couple nights;Then decided she would stay the rest of her life;I watch my little children;Play some board game in the kitchen;And I sit and pray they never feel my strife;;But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone;He made some bad investments;Now the accounts are overdrawn;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Honey its your son;I think I borrowed just too much;We had taxes,, we had bills;We had a lifestyle to front;And tonight I swear I'll come home;And well make love like were young;Tomorrow youll cook dinner;For the neighbors and their kids;We can rip apart those socialists;And all their damn taxes;Youll see I am no criminal;Im down on both bad knees;Im just too much a coward;To admit when Im in need;;[Hook]
