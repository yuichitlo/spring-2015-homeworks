;[Verse 1: Ariana Grande];How soon do we forget how we felt?;Dealing with emotions that never left;Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game;Maybe I'm the sinner,, and you're the saint;Gotta stop pretending what we ain't;Why we pointing fingers anyway? When we're the same;;[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande];Break up,, make up,, total waste of time;Can we please make up our minds?;And stop acting like were blind;Cause if the water dries up;And the moon stops shining;Stars fall,, and the world goes blind;Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you,, for you;;[Chorus: Ariana Grande];Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made;But we hold on,, hold on;There's no pot of gold at the rainbows we chase;But we hold on,, hold on,, yeah;;[Verse 2: Big Sean];I guess time's wasting,, tick-tocking,, lip locking;How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?;Wear your heart up on your sleeve so watch out for pickpockets;I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it;Hold up,, I know love can be a beach with no shore;I done count to ten,, lost my temper and went back to four;I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need;I had a dream we branched out,, started a family tree,, huh;And I feel like that everything we do is overdue;You asked why I love your mom so much,, cause she's a older you;I wish you that were happy,, I guess that's the one thing I should be providing;Aint no number twos,, we both ones of ones and we the oddest;Couple,, only humans 'cept you,, you a goddess;Only lying to you when I lie you down,, just being honest;When you start as friends,, it's hard to say you're never going back;If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Outro: Ariana Grande &amp,; (Big Sean)];You're,, you're,, you're,, you're;I be savin' my love for you,, for you;You're,, you're,, you're,, you're;(Best mistake you ever had);I be savin' my love for you,, for you
