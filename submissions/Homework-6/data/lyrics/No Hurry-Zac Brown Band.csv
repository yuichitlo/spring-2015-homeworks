;[Verse 1];You know my old car needs washing;And the front yard needs a trim;And the telephone keeps ringing;And the boss-man knows I know its him;And the bills aren't going to pay themselves;No matter anyway;Because I'm in no hurry today;;There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole;And the smell of early spring;Sit down in a fold-up easy chair;On a quiet shady river bank;Let the world go on without me;Wouldn't have it any other way;Because I'm in no hurry today;;[Chorus];Ain't in no hurry;I'd Be a fool now to worry;About all those things I can't change;And the time that I borrow;Can wait until tomorrow;Because I'm in no hurry today;;[Verse 2];When I must return;To the cold cold ground;Have them take their time;When they lay this sinner down;Heaven knows that I'm not perfect;I've raised a little cain;And I plan to raise a whole lot more;Before I hear those angels sing;(Going to get right with the lord);But there'll be hell to pay;But I'm in no hurry;;[Chorus]
