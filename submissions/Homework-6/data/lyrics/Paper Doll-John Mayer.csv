;[Verse 1];Paper doll,, come try it on;Step out of that black chiffon;Heres a dress of gold and blue;Sure was fun being good to you;;This one we made just for fall;And winter runs a bit too small;This mint green is new for Spring;My love didn't cost a thing;;[Chorus];Youre like twenty-two girls in one;And none of them know what theyre running from;Was it just too far to fall?;For a little paper doll;;[Verse 2];Fold a scarf,, Moroccan red;And tie your hair behind your head;Strap into some heels that hurt;You should've kept my undershirt;;[Chorus];;[Guitar Solo];;[Verse 3];Cut the cord and pull some strings;And make yourself some angel wings;And if those angel wings dont fly;Someones going to paint you another sky;;[Chorus]
