;[Verse 1];Girl I'm ready if you're ready now;Oh,, as I'm ever gonna be;If you're with it then I'm with it now;To accept all responsibility;I go out of my way to live by the words that you say;I don't wanna be the same;;[Chorus];Maybe you could change me;Maybe you could change me;Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes;Make all my wrongs right;Change me,, change me;;[Verse 2];Don't fight fire with fire;If I'm screaming,, talk quieter;Understanding and patient;Feel the pain that I'm facing;Be like serenity;Help reposition my mind;Take a chance make a difference,, in my life;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Girl I'm ready if you're ready now;Oh,, as I'm ever gonna be;If you're with it then I'm with it now
