;[Verse 1];I know how to hold a grudge;I can send a bridge up in smoke;And I can't count the people I've let down,, the hearts I've broke;You ain't gotta dig too deep;If you wanna find some dirt on me;I'm learning who you've been;Ain't who you've got to be;It's gonna be an uphill climb;Aw honey I won't lie;;[Chorus];I ain't no angel;I still got a few more dances with the devil;Im cleaning up my act little by little;Im getting there;I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see;I aint as good as Im gonna get;But Im better than I used to be;;[Verse 2];Ive pinned a lot of demons to the ground;Ive got a few old habits left;But theres still one or two I might need you to help me get;Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust;But put some faith in me;And someday youll see;Theres a diamond under all this dust;;;[Chorus];;[Chorus]
