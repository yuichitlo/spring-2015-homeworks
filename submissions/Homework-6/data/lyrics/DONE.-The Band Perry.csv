;[Verse 1];You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down;It's been a while since you've treated me right;You strung me along for far too long;Cause I never gave up the fight;Until now;;[Verse 2];It's gonna hit you hard 'til you see stars;Its gonna put you through a world of hurt;Oh,, I don't believe in getting even;But giving what you deserve;Oh my,, oh my,, huh;;[Bridge];Mama always told me that I should play nice;She didn't know you when she gave me that advice;I'm through with you;You're one bridge I'd like to burn;Bottle up the ashes,, smash the urn;I'm through with you,, la dee da;;[Chorus];I don't wanna be your just for fun;Don't wanna be under your thumb;All I wanna be is done;Done;;[Verse 3];You crossed the line too many times;I'm gonna put you in your place;You play with dynamite,, don't be surprised;When I blow up in your face;Oh my,, oh my,, huh;;[Bridge];;[Chorus];;[Interlude];Done with your selfish ways;Done and all the games you play;I'm through with you and everything you say;;[Bridge];;[Chorus];;[Outro];Hey,, hey,, ooh;I wanna be done (so done);So done (so done);So done
