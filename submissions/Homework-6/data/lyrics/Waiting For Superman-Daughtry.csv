;[Verse 1];She's watching the taxi driver,, he pulls away;She's been locked up inside her apartment a hundred days;She says,, Yeah,, he's still coming,, just a little bit late;He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape;She's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name;Like Lois Lane;And she smiles,, oh the way she smiles;;[Chorus];She's talking to angels,, counting the stars;Making a wish on a passing car;She's dancing with strangers,, falling apart;Waiting for Superman to pick her up;In his arms,, in his arms;Waiting for Superman;;[Verse 2];She's out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse;Nothing's making sense;She's been chasing an answer;A sign lost in the abyss,, this Metropolis;She says,, yeah he's still coming just a little bit late;He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day;She says,, if life was a movie then it wouldn't end like this;Left without a kiss;She smiles,, the way she smiles yeah;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];To lift her up and take her anywhere;Show her love and climbing through the air;Save her now before it's too late tonight;Oh,, like a speeding light;And she smiles;;[Chorus];;[Verse 4];To lift her up and take her anywhere;Show her love and climbing through the air;Save her now before it's too late tonight;She's waiting for Superman
