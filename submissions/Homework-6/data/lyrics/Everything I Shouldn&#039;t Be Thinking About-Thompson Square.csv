;It was more my fault than yours;I can say that now for sure;What I held back,, while the poison spread;Was everything I should have said;;Well I shoulda told you the truth;Before the damage done;We were in trouble,, long before I fled;With everything I should have said;;Everything I should have said;Im sorry I hurt you;Made you feel abandoned;Robbed you of your dreams;So I could steal mine;Im not asking for forgiveness;Time heals but it dont forget;Everything I should have said;;Is it too late to say it now;Were both better off somehow;My love for you was never a lie;I just didnt know what to do when it died;;Everything I should have said;Im sorry I hurt you;Made you feel abandoned;Robbed you of your dreams;So I could steal mine;Im not asking for forgiveness;Time heals but it dont forget;;Everything I should have said;I still havent told you yet;Everything I should have said;Still havent told you yet;Everything I should have said;;It was more my fault than yours;;Songwriter:  Radney Foster
