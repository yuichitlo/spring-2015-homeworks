If you don't,, like,, that would also be cool,, because I only spent all day cooking it,, right,, and like,, I was the one who got it together to put the lentils on to soak last night,, but maybe we should just get a cat,, right,, and give it to the cat,, 'cause it's obvious none of you can be both-- guys? Maybe it'd be cool if I just died,, right?;;[RICK runs past NEIL and into the drawing room without a word.
