;I was five,, and he was six;We rode on horses made of sticks;He wore black,, and I wore white;He would always win the fight;;Bang bang. He shot me down;Bang bang. I hit the ground;Bang bang. That awful sound;Bang bang. My baby shot me down;;Seasons came,, and changed the time;When I grew up I called him mine;He would always laugh and say;Remember when we used to play;;Bang bang. I shot you down;Bang bang. You hit the ground;Bang bang. That awful sound;Bang bang. I used to shoot you down;;Music played,, and people sang;Just for me the church bells rang;;Now he's gone,, I don't know why;And till this day sometimes I cry;He didn't even say Goodbye;He didn't take the time to lie;;Bang bang. He shot me down;Bang bang. I hit the ground;Bang bang. That awful sound;Bang bang. My baby shot me down
