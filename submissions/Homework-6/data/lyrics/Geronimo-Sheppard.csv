;[Verse 1];Can you feel it?;Now it's coming back we can steal it;If we bridge this gap;I can see you;Through the curtains of the waterfall;When I lost it;Yeah you held my hand;But I tossed it;Didn't understand;You were waiting;As I dove into the waterfall;;[Chorus];So say Geronimo!;Say Geronimo! (6x);Can you feel my love?;Bombs away (3x);Can you feel my love?;Bombs away (3x);Say Geronimo!;;[Verse 2];Well we rushed it;Moving way too fast;That we crushed it;But it's in the past;We can make this leap;Through the curtains of the waterfall;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3/Bridge];Well I'm just a boy;With a broken toy;All lost and coy;At the curtains of the waterfall;So it's here I stand;As a broken man;But I've found my friend;At the curtains of the waterfall;Now I'm falling down;Through the crashing sound;And you've come around;At the curtains of the waterfall;And you rushed to me;And it sets us free;So I fall to my knees;At the curtains of the waterfall;;[Chorus];So Say Geronimo!;Say Geronimo! (6x);;[Outro];Can you feel (Say Geronimo! (4x) my love?;Bombs away! (3x) (Say Geronimo! (4x);Can you feel (make this leap (3x) my love? Make this leap;Can you feel my love?
