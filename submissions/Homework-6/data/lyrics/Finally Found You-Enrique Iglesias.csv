;[Verse 1] [Enrique Iglesias];You know I'm going to get you,, yeah;Whatever it takes to,, get there;No I won't drop you;Like everybody else does;;[Hook];Forget about your friends,, they don't care where we go;If they do,, we'll get lost in a crowd of people;I've been looking for you;Forever baby we go;Together baby we go,, we go;In this crazy world of choices,, I've only got a few;Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you;Because I finally found,, I finally found you;You never have to worry if what I say is true;Girl I've been looking for you;And when I saw you I knew;That I finally found,, I finally found you;;[Verse 2];I'm coming I'll get ya,, yeah;We have a connection,, that's right;Because girl I'm not letting go;I'm gonna make you feel right,, oh yeah;;[Hook];;[Verse 3] [Sammy Adams];Yeah,, so can I get love,, too much to ask for;Really so tough;Find yourself moving with the sex of the drums;Got my hands full,, grabbing all these girls,, girls;Hands up,, hands up,, dance floor chilling when I hold two cups;Can't stop spilling because I'm drunk as fuck;And my song comes on and the club goes nuts;Every time the side goes,, seems to you sleep,, best that to you know;Running around,, and doing all these shows;Round the whole globe,, I come,, and you go girl;And you need to think of it;Just wrap for the night,, baby live a bit;With a place to hit,, and your pants to zip;You can make a scene and party,, are you into it;;[Hook]
