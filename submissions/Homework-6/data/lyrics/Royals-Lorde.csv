;[Produced by Joel Little];;[Verse 1];I've never seen a diamond in the flesh;I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies;And I'm not proud of my address;In the torn up town,, no post code envy;;[Pre-Chorus];But every song's like,, gold teeth,, Grey Goose,, trippin' in the bathroom;Blood stains,, ball gowns,, trashin' the hotel room;We don't care,; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams;But everybody's like,, Cristal,, Maybach,, diamonds on your timepiece;Jet planes,, islands,, tigers on a gold leash;We don't care,; we aren't caught up in your love affair;;[Chorus];And we'll never be royals (royals);It don't run in our blood;That kind of luxe just ain't for us;We crave a different kind of buzz;Let me be your ruler (ruler),, you can call me Queen Bee;And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...);Let me live that fantasy;;[Verse 2];My friends and I we've cracked the code;We count our dollars on the train to the party;And everyone who knows us knows;That we're fine with this,, we didn't come from money;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];(Oooh ooooh ohhh);We're bigger than we ever dreamed;And I'm in love with being queen;(Oooooh ooooh ohhhhh);Life is great,, without a care;We aren't caught up in your love affair;;[Chorus]
