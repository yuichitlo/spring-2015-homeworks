;[Wordless Intro];;[Chorus];Stripped to the waist we fall into the river;Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret;I've been trying to hide;We held our breath to see our names are written;On the wreck of '86;That was the year I knew the panic was over;;Yes since we found out;Since we found out;;[Hook];That anything could happen;Anything could happen;Anything could happen;Anything could happen;Anything could happen;Anything could happen;Anything could;;[Wordless Intro];;[Verse 1];After the war we said we'd fight together;I guess we thought that's just what humans do;Letting darkness grow;As if we need its palette and we need its color;;But now I've seen it through;And now I know the truth;;[Hook];;[Wordless Intro];;[Verse 2];Baby,, I'll give you everything you need;I'll give you everything you need,, oh;I'll give you everything you need;But I don't think I need you;;[Chorus];Stripped to the waist we fall into the river;Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret;I've been trying to hide;We held our breath to see our names are written;On the wreck of '86;That was the year I knew the panic was over;;[Hook];;[Outro];I know it's going to be (x8);;But I don't think I need you (x4)
