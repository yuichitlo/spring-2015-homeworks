;[Verse 1: Vinz];Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?;Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?;I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing;Just cause everybody doing what they all do;If one thing I know - I'll fall but I'll grow;I'm walking down this road of mine,, this road that I call home;;[Hook: Vinz];So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real?;Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see?;But that's just how I feel,, that's just how I feel;That's just how I feel,, trying to reach the things that I can't see;;[Verse 2: Nico];Am I tripping for having a vision?;My prediction - ;I'mma be on top of the world;Walk your walk and don't look back;Always do what you decide;Don't let them control your life;That's just how I feel;Fight for yours and don't let go;Don't let them compare you,, no;Don't worry,, you're not alone;That's just how we feel;;[Hook];;[Bridge: Nico] x2;If you tell me I'm wrong,, wrong;I don't wanna be right,, right;If you tell me I'm wrong,, wrong;I don't wanna be right;;[Hook] x2
