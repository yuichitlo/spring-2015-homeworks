;[Verse 1];I gotta girl crush,, hate to admit it but;I gotta heart rush,, aint slowin down;I got it real bad,, want everything she has;That smile and the midnight laugh shes givin you now;;[Chorus];I wanna taste her lips,, yeah,, cause they taste like you;I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume;I want her long blonde hair,, I want her magic touch;Yeah,, cause maybe then,, youd want me just as much;I gotta girl crush,, I gotta girl crush;;[Verse 2];I dont get no sleep,, I dont get no peace;Thinkin about her under your bed sheets;The way that shes whisperin,, the way that shes pullin you in;Lord knows Ive tried,, I cant get her off my mind;;[Chorus];I wanna taste her lips,, yeah,, cause they taste like you;I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume;I want her long blonde hair,, I want her magic touch;Yeah,, cause maybe then,, youd want me just as much;I gotta girl crush,, I gotta girl crush;;I gotta girl crush,, hate to admit it but;I gotta heart rush,, it aint slowin down
