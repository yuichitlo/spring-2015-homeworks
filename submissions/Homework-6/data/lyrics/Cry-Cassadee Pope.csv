;[Verse 1];I wish I could break your heart;I wish I could bring you down;Just for a second,, teach you a lesson;About being alone in the dark;;I wish I could make you cry;So hard you can barely breathe;And maybe you just might know what it feels like;Oh to be me;;[Chorus];Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby;But it'd be nice to know that I could;Be strong enough to pull you under;Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would;Oh I wish I could break;I wish I could break your heart;;[Verse 2];I wish I could crash your dreams;I wish I could turn back time;Boy I'd lead you on;Light the fuse,, drop the bomb;Just so I'd be the first to leave;;[Chorus];Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby;But it'd be nice to know that I could;Be strong enough to pull you under;Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would;Oh I wish I could break;I wish I could break your heart;Your heart;;I wish I could break your heart;I wish I could make you cry;I wish I could turn back time;;[Chorus];Well the truth is that I never ever wanna hurt you baby;But it'd be nice to know that I could;Be strong enough to pull you under;Throw you back a little thunder even though I never would;Oh I wish I could break;I wish I could break your heart
