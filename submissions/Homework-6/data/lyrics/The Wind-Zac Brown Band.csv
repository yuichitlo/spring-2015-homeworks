;[Verse 1];30,,000 feet above;The city where I fell in love with you;And the fading concrete skyline;Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true;When I passed you on the street that day;Should've let that red scarf fly away;Like any chance I had of keeping you;Like the Northern wind blowing;Yeah,, my lonely heart was frozen;Never knew I'd find a way to break yours,, too;;[Chorus];Where the wind blows babe;You can bet I will be riding high with it;Holding on for my dear life just like I always did;Close your eyes babe,, take a breath;Say my name and I will be there;My love will find you anywhere;Anywhere my love;;[Verse 2];The city lights look like a country sky;Like staring at the stars turned upside down;I wish I may,, I wish I might;Find it in your heart to stick around;I hate it had to end this way;Tomorrow is a brand new day;And the chances here at love are precious few;Someone's out there waiting;For a sweet good timing lady;To make you smile the way I always wanted to;;[Chorus];;[Outro];So I will fly all night;Our memory's my lullaby;That love will not lie;If it is love done right;You will be waiting on the other side;Arms open wide;If love do not lie;Lie;We can fly
