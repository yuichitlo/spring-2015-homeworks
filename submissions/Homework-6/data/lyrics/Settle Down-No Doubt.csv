;[Intro];Get get get in line,, and settle down;Get in line,, and settle down;;[Verse 1];What's your twenty?;Where's your brain?;Checking in to check you out;Concerned about your whereabouts;Copy that,, you're acting strange;So tell me what is going on;So heavy I bet;;[Bridge];I'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down);I'm feeling positive for real,, I'm all good no;I'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down);It's gotten complicated that's for sure;;[Chorus];But you can see it my eyes,, you can read on my lips;I'm trying to get a hold on this;And I really mean it this time;And you know it's such a trip;Don't get me started;I'm trying to get a hold on this;Get get get in line,, and settle down;Get in line,, and settle down;;[Verse 2];No big deal (I can handle it);It'll bounce off me (I can handle it);In or out,, moved block before,, doesn't matter anymore;Here we go again,, are you insane?;We're underneath the avalanche so heavy again;;[Bridge + Chorus];;[Verse 3];I'm a rough and tough,, I'm a rough and tough;And nothing's gonna knock this girl down;I'm a rough and tough,, I'm a rough and tough;And nothing's gonna knock this girl down;I'm a rough and tough,, I'm a rough and tough;And nothing's gonna knock this girl down;I'm a rough and tough,, I'm a rough and tough;;[Chorus]
