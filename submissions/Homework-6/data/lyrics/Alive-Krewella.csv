;[Verse 1: Jahan];Let's make this fleeting moment last forever;So,, tell me what you're waiting for?;I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever;There's no regretting anymore;It's worth the wait,, even so far away;I'm making the night mine until the day I die;No lights to brake when you're hanging by fate;You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind;;[Pre-Hook: Jahan];All alone,, just the beat inside my soul;Take me home,, where my dreams are made of gold;In the zone,, where the beat is uncontrolled;;[Hook: Jahan];I know what it feels like;Come on make me feel alive;Feel alive,, feel alive;Feel alive,, feel alive;Feel alive,, feel alive;Feel alive,, feel alive;Feel alive,, feel alive!;;[Verse 2: Yasmine];Meet me under shining lights;I've been waiting right here all my life;Feelings;You can't deny that you're living,, open up your eyes;And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter;Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter;Every second here makes my heart beat faster;Finally think I found what I've been chasing after;;[Pre Hook + Hook: Jahan] 2X
