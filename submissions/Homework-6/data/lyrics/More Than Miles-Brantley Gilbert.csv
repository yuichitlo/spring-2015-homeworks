;[Verse 1];Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard;Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel;Yeah,, I bet she's still crying on that front porch;Yeah,, this time it's gonna take some time to heal;;[Chorus];Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee;Singing Georgia On My Mind;Chasing what they say's a dream;Thinking maybe it ain't mine;Cause that girl's in every song I sing;She's in every song I write;And that six string ridin' in her seat;Won't keep me warm tonight;God what am I supposed to do;There's more than miles in my rearview;;[Verse 2];Well,, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted;And trying not to buy into my doubts;But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering;Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Yeah,, more than miles;Yeah,, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors;Cause every time I look behind me I see her;I think I just realized how much I need her;;[Chorus];;[Outro];More than miles,, yeah;More than miles
