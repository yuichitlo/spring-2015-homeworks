;[Verse 1: Avril Lavigne];Love that once hung on the wall;Used to mean something,, but now it means nothing;The echoes are gone in the hall;But I still remember,, the pain of December;;[Pre-Chorus: Avril Lavigne];Oh,, there isn't one thing left you could say;I'm sorry it's too late;;[Chorus: Avril Lavigne &amp,; Chad Kroeger];I'm breaking free from these memories;Gotta let it go,, just let it go;I've said goodbye;Set it all on fire;Gotta let it go,, just let it go;;[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger];You came back to find I was gone;And that place is empty,, like the hole that was left in me;Like we were nothing at all;It's not what you meant to me;Thought we were meant to be;;[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger];Oh,, there isn't one thing left you could say;I'm sorry it's too late;;[Chorus: Avril Lavigne &amp,; Chad Kroeger];;[Bridge: Avril Lavigne &amp,; (Chad Kroeger)];I let it go (and now I know);A brand new life (is down this road);And when it's right (you always know);So this time (I won't let go!);;[Pre-Chorus 2: Avril Lavigne];There's only one thing left here to say,;;Love's never too late!;;[Chorus 2: Avril Lavigne];I've broken free from those memories;I've let it go,, I've let it go;And two goodbyes;Led to this new life;Don't let me go,, don't let me go;;[Outro: Avril Lavigne];(Oh oh);(Oh oh);Don't let me go;Don't let me go;Don't let me go;Don't let me go (oh-oh);;Won't let you go;Don't let me go;Won't let you go;Don't let me go;;Won't let you go;Don't let me go;Won't let you go;Don't let me go
