;[Verse 1];Things were all good yesterday;And then the devil took your memory;And if you fell to your death today;I hope that heaven is your resting place;I heard the doctors put your chest in pain;But then that could've been the medicine;And now you're lying in the bed again;Either way I'll cry with the rest of them;;[Pre-Chorus];And my father told me son;It's not his fault he doesn't know your face;And you're not the only one;Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing;;[Chorus];Darling,, hold me in your arms the way you did last night;And we'll lie inside for a little while here,, oh;I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up;And we're wrapped in light and life and love;Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut;For they're designed to be together,, oh;With your body next to mine,, our hearts will beat as one;And we're set alight,, we're afire love;;[Verse 2];And things were all good yesterday;But then the devil took your breath away;And now we're left here in the pain;Black suit,, black tie,, standing in the rain;And now my family is one again;Stapled together with the strangers and a friend;Came to my mind,, I should paint it with a pen;Six years old,, I remember when;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And my father and all of my family;Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah;And my mother and all of my family;Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah;And my brother and all of my family;Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah;And my father and all of my family;Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah;;[Outro]
