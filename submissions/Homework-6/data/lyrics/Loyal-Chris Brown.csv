;Verse 1:;Ill make her Say Aah,, but Ill never say I do;She on the low trying to make J rise (J-Reyez) and make Thai food;She got a thing for showrunners,, a fetish like no wonder;She aint loyal but am I gon fuck her? Im Shogunna (sure gonna);If she single I can flip her over to her B-side;She swallowed her integrity and showed my D pride (D-Pryde);Dumbfoundead by her ho-ish ways,, said she love my singing voice;Promiscuous but want me to hit without a Jimmy,, boy (JimmyBoi);Not to be trusted,, I aint got a lot to tell her;So I do the dame and dash (Damon Dash) before she can rock a fella (Rocafella);With lies and broken promises pre-rehearsed if she Gs you first;Or even worse,, when she need a purse,, to measure and see your worth;;Chorus:;When a rich brother want you (want you babe);And your man just cant do nothing for you (nothing,, no);These hoes aint loyal (2x);;Verse 2:;Girl if I got rich,, would you wanna be my down-ass chick (like right away);Girl if I blew up,, would you come follow?;I know girl...with me,, you do things you wont with your man;On the low-low girl,, with your legs in the air,, you never stood a chance;Cmon,, cmon girl why you frontin;Baby,, show me something;When I call her,, she gon leave;And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat;;Chorus (2x);;Verse 3:;Cmon,, cmon girl why you frontin;Baby,, show me something;When I call her,, she gon leave;And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat;Cmon,, cmon girl why you frontin;Baby,, show me something;You done spent your bread on her;And its all for nothing;;Chorus
