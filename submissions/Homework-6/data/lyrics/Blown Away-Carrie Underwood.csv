;[Intro: Jet 2];What's up?;Aww...;Said I'm just havin' fun before the Terminal (3x);Alright;;[Verse 1: Jet 2];Look at your beautiful physique;Body fit,, pretty face,, what is that,, Clinique?;If it wasn't for your pack of homegirls,, I'd say you're unique;Y'all are the simple reason why the city's in a frenzy;Pretty and pretty creative with everything in between;Tryin' to get that contact in every meaning except for lenses;In it until I'm relieved,, end it after you're relieved;And right before we leave,, I come back to my senses;;[Hook: Chris Brown];It really don't matter to me;Lovin' all these girls,, cause all these girls love me;Under the sheets,, private party wit' yo' body,, I'm a freak;Money ain't a thang,, thang,, and I'mma do my thang,, thang;I'm on some G-shit,, baby (2x);;[Verse 2: Jet 2];Had to throw that Chris Brown in,, cause I love the hook;Throw that Chris Brown on,, get you in the mood,, I love your look;Model fine,, you got that,, I have been on a cover look;Girl you got that,, daaang! I had to take another look;Right before them others look,, look here,, G shit;Girl you got me blown away,, you on some Carrie Underwood;Yeah,, make my imagination wonder would;You ever have to sit,, because that ahh is very understood;Standin' up stuntin',, see behind it from the front end;You're a perfect ten like a fast runner in the hundred;Meter dash,, girl you see that stance is like you're lungin';And me in all my ignorance just wanna plunge in;And be a bridge,, I will hover over like London;Or I could be la agua,, take a dip in while I'm under it;See you been workin' all year;I know you can't wait 'til the summer and;If it gets too hot then I got you;I'll put you up in the clouds where the thunder is;Nah,, I'm lying.. I'm not,, I just really am fantasizing;Beating it like the battery,, half of me energizing;I'm crackin' it like a pack of seeds;Set it up like an actin' scene;Bussin' everywhere,, it's just the Yosemite Sam in me;Carefully analyzing your shape;While you switch and it swings like a Samurai's in yo' waist;That shit vicious;It's takin' me on a trip,, it is teasing my inner-vision;Me and I wanna split it like division through split decision;Watch yo' back go in while yo' paragraph is like an indent;An essay isn't finished unless my thesis is in it;Feelin' like experimenting with our kismet like a chemist;If my key is in ignition would it start up like an engine?;So don't be wonderin' what I'm starin' at;Talkin' 'bout you ain't tryin' to,, I ain't hearin' that;Just know that your terminal is the mission;As long as it's in my vision,, I ain't trippin';Shorty so it really don't;;[Hook: Chris Brown]
