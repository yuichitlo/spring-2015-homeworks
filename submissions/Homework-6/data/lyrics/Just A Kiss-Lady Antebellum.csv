;[Verse 1];Lying here with you so close to me;It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe;Caught up in this moment;Caught up in your smile;;[Verse 2];I've never opened up to anyone;So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms;We don't need to rush this;Let's just take this slow;;[Chorus];Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight;Just a touch in the fire burning so bright;And I don't want to mess this thing up;I don't want to push too far;Just a shot in the dark that you just might;Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life;So baby I'm alright,, with just a kiss goodnight;;[Verse 3];I know that if we give this a little time;It will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find;It's never felt so real,, no it's never felt so right;;[Chorus];Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight;Just a touch in the fire burning so bright;And I don't want to mess this thing up;I don't want to push too far;Just a shot in the dark that you just might;Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life;So baby I'm alright,, with just a kiss goodnight;;[Bridge];No I don't want to say goodnight;I know it's time to leave,, but you'll be in my dreams;Tonight;Tonight;Tonight;;[Chorus];Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight;Just a touch in the fire burning so bright;And I don't want to mess this thing up;I don't want to push too far;Just a shot in the dark that you just might;Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life;So baby I'm alright,, oh,, let's do this right,, with just a kiss goodnight;With a kiss goodnight;Kiss goodnight
