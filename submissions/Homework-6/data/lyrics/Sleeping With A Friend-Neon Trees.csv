;[Verse 1];All my friends,, theyre different people;Anxious like the ocean in a storm;When we go out,, yeah,, were electric;Coursing through our bodies til were one;;And why mess up a good thing,, baby?;Its a risk to even fall in love;So,, when you give that look to me;I better look back carefully;Cause this is trouble,, yeah this is trouble;;[Hook];I said ooh,, ooh;You got me in the mood,, mood;Im scared,, but if my hearts gonna break;Before the night will end;I said,, ooh,, ooh were in danger;Sleeping with a friend,, sleeping with a friend;;[Verse 2];All my friends,, stay up past midnight;Looking for the thing to fill the void;I dont go out much like I used to;Something bout the strangers and the noise;;And why leave when I got you,, baby?;Its a risk but babe,, I need the thrill;I never said youd be easy;But if it was all up to me;Id be no trouble,, hey,, were in trouble;;[Hook];;[Bridge];We are both young,, hot-blooded people;We dont wanna die alone;Two become one,, it could be lethal;Sleeping with a friend;;[Hook]
