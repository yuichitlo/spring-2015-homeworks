;[Verse 1];I can hold my breath;I can bite my tongue;I can stay awake for days;If that's what you want;Be your number one;I can fake a smile;I can force a laugh;I can dance and play the part;If that's what you ask;Give you all I am;;[Pre-Chorus];I can do it;I can do it;I can do it;;[Chorus];But I'm only human;And I bleed when I fall down;I'm only human;And I crash and I break down;Your words in my head,, knives in my heart;You build me up and then I fall apart;Cause I'm only human;;[Verse 2];I can turn it on;Be a good machine;I can hold the weight of worlds;If that's what you need;Be your everything;;[Pre-Chorus &amp,; Chorus];;[Bridge];I'm only human;I'm only human;Just a little human;;[Interlude];I can take so much;'Til I've had enough
