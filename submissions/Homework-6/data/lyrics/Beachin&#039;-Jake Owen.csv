;[Verse 1];So just watching her blonde hair,, sun burn,, stare at them,, wack caps rolling over;Laid back in a thrift store beach chair,, dropping limes in her Corona;Well she looks back,, yeah,, she throws me a kiss,, like honey I sure want you;And it's a hundred and three between her and me and only 92 in Daytona;;[Chorus];And it's sunshine,, blue eyes,, tan lines,, so tight;Rolling white sand,, cold can koozie in my hand,, just a summertime story;Chilling,, breazing,, sipping,, singing whoaoaoh;Beaching;;[Verse 2];We got 2-for-1s,, we're at a margarita bar,, whatever happens happens;And there's a reggae band,, full of dread head,, just sittin' in the corner laughing;Well my baby walks over,, drops a 20 in a jar,, she smiles and shakes it at me;Yeah,, she gets 'em going,, she gets 'em playing a little,, don't worry be happy;;[Chorus] [x2];;[Outro];Beaching,, sunshine,, blue eyes,, tan lines,, so tight;Rolling white sand,, cold can koozie in my hand
