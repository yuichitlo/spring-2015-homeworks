;My friends call me up cause they know I'm down;Take me out to paint the town and help me get over it;Pretty blonde girl at the end of the bar;Buys a drink,, gives a wink,, and then it goes too far;We're out on the dance floor feelin' the gin;I finally start coming alive again;I take her home for the night;And everything is right until the first ray of sunlight;And damn if I don't wake up lovin' you;;Oh I wake up lovin' you;;Thought if I could catch a plane,, touch down,, out of town;Somewhere nobody knows you;Maybe I could give myself half of a chance;To get a life and act a like a different man;But my best of intentions were all shot to hell;And I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel;Drownin' in the whiskey,, starin' at the T.V.,, tryin' not to sleep;Cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you;;Yeah I wake up lovin' you,, yeah;;Yeah I wake up lovin' you;Yeah I wake up lovin' you;;Remember when I told you I was never going to stop;Lovin' you with all my heart and soul no matter what;Now it seems I'm breaking every promise that I made;Cause every night I'm desperate;Askin' God if He would just let me forget it;But I wake up lovin' you;;I wake up lovin' you;;I wake up lovin' you,, yeah;I wake up lovin' you,, yeah;I wake up lovin' you,, oh;I wake up lovin' you;I wake up lovin' you;I wake up lovin' you
