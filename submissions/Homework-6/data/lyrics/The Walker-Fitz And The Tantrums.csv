;(Chorus 1);Ooh,, crazy's what they think about me;Ain't gonna stop cause they tell me so;Cause 99 miles per hour baby;Is how fast that I like to go;;(Hook);Can't keep up with my rhythm;Though they keep trying;Too quick for the lines they throw;I walk to the sound of my own drum;It goes,, they go,, we go,, hey yeah yeah yeah;;(Hook2);Oh,, here we go;Feel it in my soul;Really mean it,, mean it,, so go;Gotta feel it,, honey takes control;Really mean it,, mean it;;(Chorus 2);I wake up to the city of angels;To see my name headlining the coast;They say I'm a walking dreamer,, baby;If I stop they would make the show;;(Hook);Can't keep up with my rhythm;Though they keep trying;Too quick for the lines they throw;I walk to the sound of my own drum;It goes,, they go,, we go,, hey yeah yeah yeah;;(Hook2);Oh,, here we go;Feel it in my soul;Really mean it,, mean it,, so go;Gotta feel it,, honey takes control;Really mean it,, mean it;;(Hook2);Hey,, here we go;Feel it in my soul;Really mean it,, mean it,, so go;Gotta feel it,, honey takes control;Really mean it,, mean it;;(Hook 3);Everybody walk;Everybody walk;Everybody walk,, walk,, walk;;(Hook2);Oh,, here we go;Feel it in my soul;Really mean it,, mean it,, so go;Gotta feel it,, honey takes control;Really mean it,, mean it;;(Hook2);Oh,, here we go;Feel it in my soul;Really mean it,, mean it,, so go;Gotta feel it,, honey takes control;Really mean it,, mean it
