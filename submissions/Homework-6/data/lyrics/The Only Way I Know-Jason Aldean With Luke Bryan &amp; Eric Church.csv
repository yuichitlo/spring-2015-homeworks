;[Verse 1];Well,, I grew up in one of them old farm towns;Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down;Nobody really seemed to care;That we were living in the middle of nowhere;We just figured thats how it was;And everybody else was just like us;Soaking in the rain baking in the sun;Dont quit 'til the job gets done;;[Hook];Thats the only way I know;Dont stop 'til everythings gone;Straight ahead,, never turn round;Dont back up,, dont back down;Full throttle,, wide open;You get tired and you dont show it;Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more;Thats the only way I know;;[Verse 2];That old red dirt,, the first thing you learn;Is you dont get nothing that you dont earn;Humble pride that I grew up on;You find out just how bad you want it;Sun in our eyes backs to the fences;We didnt know the odds were against us;Hit the wall smoking and spinning;Still wasnt thinking bout nothing but winning;;[Hook];;Maybe theres another path that;Will get you there a little bit faster;But Im sticking with the one inside of me;;[Hook];;[Outro];That's the only way I know
