;[Verse 1];If you love somebody;Better tell them while they're here,, cause;They just may run away from you;You'll never know quite when,, well;Then again it just depends on;How long a time is left for you;I've had the highest mountains;I've had the deepest rivers;You can have it all but life keeps moving;Now take it in but don't look down;;[Chorus];Cause I'm top of the world,, ay;I'm on top of the world,, ay;'Waiting for this for a while now;Paying my dues to the dirt;I've been waiting to smile,, ay;Been holding it in for awhile,, ay;Take it with me if I can;Been dreaming of this since a child;I'm on top of the world;;[Verse 2];I've tried to cut these corners;Try to take the easy way out;I kept on falling short of something;I could've gave up then,, but;Then again I couldn't have,, cause;I've traveled all this way for something;Now take it in but don't look down;[Chorus x2];;[Bridge];And I know it's hard when you're falling down;And it's a long way up when you hit the ground;But get up now,, get up,, get up now (x2);;[Chorus]
