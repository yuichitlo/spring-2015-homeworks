;[Verse 1];Do I imagine it,, or do I see your stare?;Is there still longing there?;Oh I hate myself,, and I feel crazy;Such a classic tale;Current girlfriend,, ex girlfriend;I'm trying to be cool;Am I being paranoid,, am I seeing things?;Am I just insecure?;;[Pre-Chorus];I want to believe;It's just you and me;Sometimes it feels like there's three;Of us in here,, baby;;[Chorus];So I,, wait for you to call;And I try to act natural;Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me;And while I wait I put on my perfume;Yeah,, I want it all over you;I gotta mark my territory;;[Bridge];I'll never tell,, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume;I'll never tell,, tell on myself but I hope she smells your perfume;I hide it well,, hope you can't tell but I hope she smells my perfume;I hide it well,, hope you can't tell but I hope she smells my perfume;;[Verse 2];I wanna fill the room,, when she's in it with you;Please don't forget me;Do I imagine it,, or catch these moments;I know you got history;But I'm your girlfriend,, now I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool;I hope I'm paranoid,, that I'm just seeing things;That I'm just insecure;;[Pre-Chorus &amp,; Chorus x2 &amp,; Bridge]
