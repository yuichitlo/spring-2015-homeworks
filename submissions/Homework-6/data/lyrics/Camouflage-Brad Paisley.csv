;[Verse 1];Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school;But I remember well the day I thought now that guy's pretty cool;He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered;Because he had gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier camouflage;;Camouflage it disappears when it pulls out of his garage;Camouflage-camouflage;;[Verse 2];I asked Jenny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew;So she made a matching tux and gown from Duck Blind Mossy Oak;We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance;And the only thing that you can see is our faces and our hands;;Camouflage;Camouflage you should've seen the way it popped with her corsage;Camouflage,, camouflage,, ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage;;[Chorus 1];You can blend in in the country;You can stand out in the fashion world;Be invisible to a white tail,, irresistible to a redneck girl;;[Chorus 2];Camouflage,, camouflage;Oh you're my favorite color camouflage;;[Chorus 1];You can blend in in the country;You can stand out in the fashion world;Be invisible to a white tail,, irresistible to a redneck girl;;[Verse 3];Well the stars and bars offend some folks and I guess I see why;Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride;The only thing as patriotic is the old red white and blue;Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too;;Camouflage,, camouflage;Designed by Mother Nature and by God;;[Chorus 2];It's camouflage,, camouflage;Oh you're my favorite color camouflage
