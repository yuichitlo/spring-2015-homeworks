;[Verse 1];I had a dream so big and loud;I jumped so high,, I touched the clouds;(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh,, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh);I stretched my hands out to the sky;We danced with monsters through the night;(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh,, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh);;[Pre-Chorus];I'm never gonna look back,, whoa;Never gonna give it up,, no;Please don't wake me now;;[Chorus];This is gonna be the best day of my life;My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife;This is gonna be the best day of my life;My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife;;[Verse 2];I howled at the moon with friends;And then the sun came crashing in;(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh,, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh);But all the possibilities;No limits,, just epiphanies;(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh,, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh);;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];I hear it calling outside my window;I feel it in my soul (soul);The stars were burning so bright;The sun was out 'til midnight;I say we lose control (control);(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh);;[Chorus](2x)
