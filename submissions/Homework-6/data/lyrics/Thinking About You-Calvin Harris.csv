;[Verse 1];If I told you,, that this couldn't get better baby;And your heart beat,, it let's me know you feel the same;I can hold you,, keep you safe until you fall asleep;Never worry cause I can give you what you need;;[Bridge];Now everything I do;Is all for loving you;It's not something that we're used to;No other way to say,, I need you everyday;And now I'm gonna change my ways;And it's a part of you I never wanna lose;I'd do anything you want me to;Like any other day I know I'll find a way;And if ever I'm alone,, you say;;[Hook];I'll be thinking about you [8x];;[Verse 2];In a moment,, I know that everything can change;And I know that my life will never be the same;You're the only one that's making sense to me;When I close my eyes you're the one I see;There's no other way I can ever be without you babe;;[Bridge];;[Hook]
