;[Verse 1];We clawed,, we chained,, our hearts in vain;We jumped,, never asking why;We kissed,, I fell under your spell;A love no one could deny;;[Pre-Hook];Dont you ever say I just walked away;I will always want you;I cant live a lie,, running for my life;I will always want you;;[Hook 1];I came in like a wrecking ball;I never hit so hard in love;All I wanted was to break your walls;All you ever did was wreck me;Yeah you,, you wreck me;;[Verse 2];I put you high up in the sky;And now,, youre not coming down;It slowly turned,, you let me burn;And now,, were ashes on the ground;;[Pre-Hook &amp,; Hook 1];;[Hook 2];I came in like a wrecking ball;Yeah,, I just closed my eyes and swung;Left me crashing in a blazing fall;All you ever did was wreck me;Yeah,, you wreck me;;[Bridge];I never meant to start a war;I just wanted you to let me in;And instead of using force;I guess I shouldve let you win;I never meant to start a war;I just wanted you to let me in;I guess I shouldve let you win;;[Interlude];Dont you ever say I just walked away;I will always want you;;[Hook 1 &amp,; Hook 2]
