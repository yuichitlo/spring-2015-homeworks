;[Verse 1];Baby I got love for thee;So deep inside of me I dont know where to start;I love you more than anything;But the words cant even touch whats in my heart;;[Pre-Hook];When I try to explain it I be sounding insane;The words dont ever come out right;I get all tongue-tied (and twisted);I cant explain what Im (feeling);And I say baby,, baby,, baby;;[Hook];(Baby I) ooh baby,, oh baby,, my baby;(Baby I) ooh baby,, baby I;All Im tryna say is youre my everything baby;But every time I try to say it;Words,, they only complicate it;Baby,, baby;;[Verse 2];Baby Im so down for you;No matter what you do,, (real talk),, Ill be around;See baby I been feelin you;Before I even knew what feelings were about;;[Pre-Hook];[Hook];;[Bridge];Straight up,, you got me;All in,, how could I not be;I sure hope you know;If its even possible,, I love you more;Than word love can say it;Its better not explaining;That why I keep saying... Baby I;;[Hook x2]
