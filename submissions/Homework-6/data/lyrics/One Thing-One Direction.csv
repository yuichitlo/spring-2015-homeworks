;I tried playing it cool;Girl when I'm looking at you;I can't ever be brave;Cause you make my heart race;;Shot me out of the sky;You're my kryptonite;You keep making me weak;Yeah,, frozen and can't breathe;;[Chorus];Some things gotta give now;Cause I'm dying just to make you see;That I need you here with me now;Cause you've got that one thing;;So get out,, get out,, get out of my head;And fall into my arms instead;I don't,, I don't,, don't know what it is;But I need that one thing;And you've got that one thing;;Now I'm climbing the walls;But you don't notice at all;That I'm going out of my mind;All day and all night;;[Chorus];Some things gotta give now;Cause I'm dying just to know your name;And I need you here with me now;Cause you've got that one thing;;So get out,, get out,, get out of my head;And fall into my arms instead;I don't,, I don't,, don't know what it is;But I need that one thing;And you've got that one thing;;So get out,, get out,, get out of my mind;And come on,, come into my life;I don't,, I don't,, don't know what it is;But I need that one thing;And you've got that one thing;;You've got that one thing;;Get out,, get out,, get out of my head;And fall into my arms instead;;So get out,, get out,, get out of my head;And fall into my arms instead;I don't,, I don't,, don't know what it is;But I need that one thing;And you've got that one thing;;Get out,, get out,, get out of my mind;And come on,, come into my life;I don't,, I don't,, don't know what it is;But I need that one thing;And you've got that one thing
