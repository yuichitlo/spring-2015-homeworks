;[Verse 1: John Legend];What would I do without your smart mouth;Drawing me in,, and you kicking me out;Got my head spinning,, no kidding,, I cant pin you down;Whats going on in that beautiful mind;Im on your magical mystery ride;And Im so dizzy,, dont know what hit me,, but Ill be alright;;[Bridge: John Legend];My heads under water;But Im breathing fire;Youre crazy and Im out of my mind;;[Hook: John Legend];Cause all of me;Loves all of you;Love your curves and all your edges;All your perfect imperfections;Give your all to me;Ill give my all to you;Youre my end and my beginning;Even when I lose Im winning;Cause I give you all of me;And you give me all of you;;[Verse 2: John Legend];How many times do I have to tell you;Even when youre crying youre beautiful too;The world is beating you down,, Im around through every mood;Youre my downfall,, youre my muse;My worst distraction,, my rhythm and blues;I cant stop singing,, its ringing,, in my head for you;;[Bridge: John Legend];;[Hook: John Legend];Cards on the table,, were both showing hearts;Risking it all,, though its hard;;[Hook: John Legend];I give you all of me;And you give me all of you
