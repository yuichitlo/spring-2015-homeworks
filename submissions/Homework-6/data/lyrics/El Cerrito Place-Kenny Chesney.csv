;[Verse 1];I been hanging round this place,, I been looking through your space;I been waiting' for you,, I've been waiting' for you;All the places that you go,, all the people that you know;I've been looking for you,, I've been looking for you;;[Verse 2];And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place;They all got something in their pockets,, all got something on their face;They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard;Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars;They all say they're going' far;;[Chorus];Me I've been looking for you baby,, I've been looking for you baby;I've been looking for you baby,, I've been looking for you baby;All night long,, all night long,, all night long;;[Verse 3];Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land;So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand;Did you hear the ocean singing,, baby did you sing along;While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song;Were you even here at all?;;[Chorus];;[Verse 4];Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight;Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked;These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say;And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away;;[Verse 5];Now it's been two days;I'm still looking for you baby,, I've been looking for you baby;I've been looking for you baby,, I've been looking for you baby;All night long,, all night long,, all night long;;[Bridge];And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place;They all got something in their pockets,, all got something on their face;;Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land;So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand;;[Outro];Think I'll go back to the city,, back to El Cerrito Place;That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face;I've been looking for you baby
