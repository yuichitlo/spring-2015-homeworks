;[Verse: 1];So I guess it's over baby;Dja vu again;Who'd have thought that time don't stop;And somehow girl,, the world keeps spinning;I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man;Ain't like I'm the only one;That's in the shoes that I am;;[Chorus];Do you hear that;I'm right back;At the sound of lonely calling;Do you hear that;It's where I'm at;It's the sound of teardrops falling down,, down;A slamming door and a lesson learned;I let another lover crash and burn;;[Verse: 2];I know that it might sound jaded;And I have to say;I think love is overrated;But I don't like throwing it away;I know you could probably tell me;Right where I went wrong;Some guys can't have all the luck;If others don't sing sad songs;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];A slamming door and a lesson learned;I let another lover crash and burn;That's right;Another lover crash and burn;;[Chorus]
