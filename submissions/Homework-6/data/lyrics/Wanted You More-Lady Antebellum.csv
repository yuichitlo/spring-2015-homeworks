;[Verse 1: Charles Kelley];I kept waiting on a reason;And a call that never came;No,, I never saw it coming;Something in you must have changed;;[Verse 2: Hillary Scott];All the words unspoken,, promises broken;I cried for so long;Wasted too much time,, should've seen the signs;Now I know just what went wrong;;[Chorus];I guess I wanted you more;And looking back now,, I'm sure;I wanted you more;I guess I wanted you more;;[Verse 3: Charles Kelley];All the nights we spent,, just talking;Of the things we wanted out of life;Making plans and dreams together;Wish I'd seen,, I was just too blind;;[Verse 4: Hillary Scott];My heart was open,, exposed and hoping;For you to lay it on the line;In the end it seemed;There was no room for me;Still,, I tried to change your mind;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Oh,, I don't need you;I don't need you anymore;;[Chorus];;[Outro];I don't need you;I don't need you anymore
