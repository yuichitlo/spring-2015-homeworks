;Well I just met you a couple hours ago;;My last night in town,, hey wouldn't you know;;I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes;;Down here in Mexico,, oh;;Now you're walking up asking me to dance;;Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand;;Well there's a move or two,, I'd like to show you;;While I still got the chance;;;Well you got the soul and you know how to use it;;Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it;;You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it;;Falling in love to the beat of the music;;Oh oh,, why wouldn't I wanna stay?;;Oh oh,, and let that plane fly away,, hey hey;;;Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it;;Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it;;You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it;;Falling in love to the beat of the music;;The beat of the music;;;I think I could get used to that steel drum playing;;Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying;;One more night would be more than alright with me;;So hold on baby cause;;;You got the soul and you know how to use it;;Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it;;You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it;;Falling in love to the beat of the music;;We're falling in love to beat of the music
