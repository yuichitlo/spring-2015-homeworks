Woo!;And I'm like;;Woo!;;[Verse 2];I will follow you down wherever you go;I,, I'm baby I'm bound to you and do you know?;Closer,, pull me in tight;;[Post-Chorus];I wanna be yours,, wanna be your hero;And my heart beats;;[Chorus];;[Post-Chorus 2];Woo! Woo!;We are alive;Woo! Woo!;And I'm like!;We are alive!;;[Bridge];I'm just gonna raise my head;Welcome to the final edge;And I'm gonna fall;(And the stars make love to the universe);I'm just gonna raise my head;And hold you close;;[Chorus + Post Chorus 1]
