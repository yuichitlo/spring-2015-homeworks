;No sir I ain't been drinking;I ain't even had one beer;This sweet thing's got me buzzing;From whispering in my ear;;Just take a peek up in here;At this little hot mess;Mister,, you'll understand;I'm doing my best;;And I know I'm all over the road;I can't help but go;A little bit of left,, a little bit of right;It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee;When she's all over me,, I'm all outta control;All over the road;;Don't wanna get no ticket;Don't wanna cause no wreck;It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck;I say girl take it easy;She laughs,, says it'll be fine;How am I supposed to keep it between the lines;;Yeah I know I'm all over the road;I can't help but go;A little bit of left,, a little bit of right;It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee;When she's all over me,, I'm all outta control;And all over the road;;Something 'bout these wheels rolling;Radio playing gets her going;I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go;;And I know I'm all over the road;I can't help but go;A little bit of left,, a little bit of right;It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee;Have a little mercy on me;Sir I'm sorry I know;I'm all over the road;All over the road;All over the road
