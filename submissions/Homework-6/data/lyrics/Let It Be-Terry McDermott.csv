;[Verse 1];;I can feel you sneakin' around babe,, behind my eyes;Bring your lovin' to deep temptation,, and black thigh-highs;You might know me but I want you to say;Last night,, I thought of you again;Your one and only might have so much to say;But I still want you screamin' out my name;;[Pre-Chorus];;I know where you've been;It feels so obscene;Cause I just want to make you feel;;[Chorus];;I'm hi steppin' in your direction;For confession;I've heard you can't let go!;I'm hi steppin' in your direction;Hear my message:;I've heard you can't let go!;;[Verse 2];;If it ain't resurrection honey,, we're on repeat;Coming right to the beat and emotion;That came with me;You say you've only got love for one and only;Things ain't the way they were back in the day;We both might be caught in each other's gravity;Collidin' with each other once again;;[Pre-Chorus];;You know where I've been;It feels so obscene;;[Chorus 2x]
