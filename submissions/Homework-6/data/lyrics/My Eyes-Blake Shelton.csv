;[Verse 1];Those high heels with that sun dress;Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck;Red lips like wine,, want to drink them up;And keep on drinking' 'til you make me drunk;;Tied up here,, want to let it down;And just let the rest fall to the ground;You take beautiful to the max;Can't help myself when you look like that;;[Chorus][x2];Come a little closer,, come a little closer;Come a little closer,, girl the way you look tonight;My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you;;[Verse 2];There's a million stars dancing in the sky;A picture perfect moon so bright;But I don't care,, I'm looking at you;From where I stand you can beat the view;;[Chorus][x2];;[Verse 3];My eyes have seen;Some amazing things;But girl,, my eyes arent seen;Nothing quite like you,, hey baby;;[Chorus][x3]
