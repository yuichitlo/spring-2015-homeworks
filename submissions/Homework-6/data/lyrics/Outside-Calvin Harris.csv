;[Verse 1];Look at what you've done;Standin' still,, fallin' away from me;When it takes so long;Fire's out,, what do you want to be?;;[Pre-Chorus];Now I'm holdin on;Myself was never enough for me;Gotta be so strong;There's a power in what you do;Now,, every other day I'll be watching you;;[Chorus];Oh,, oh;I'll show you what it feels like now I'm on the outside;Oh oh;We did everything right,, now I'm on the outside;Oh oh;I'll show you what it feels like now I'm on the outside;Oh oh;We did everything right,, now I'm on the outside;;[Verse 2];Though you give me no reason;For me to stay close to you;Tell me what lovers do;How are we still breathing?;It's never for us to choose;I'll be the strength in you;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Outro];I'll show you what it feels like;Now I'm on the outside;I'll show you what it feels like;Show you what it feels like;Now I'm on the outside;We did everything right,, now I'm on the outside
