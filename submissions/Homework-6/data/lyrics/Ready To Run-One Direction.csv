;[Verse 1: Harry Styles];There's a lightning in your eyes,, I can't deny;Then there's me inside a sinking boat,, running out of time;Without you I'll never make it out alive;But I know,, yes I know we'll be alright;;[Verse 2: Liam Payne];There's a devil in your smile it's chasing me;And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed;There's a moment when you finally realize;There's no way you can change the rolling tide;But I know,, yes I know that I'll be fine;;[Chorus: All Members];This time I'm ready to run;Escape from the city and follow the sun;Cause I wanna be yours,, don't you wanna be mine?;I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night;This time I'm ready to run;Wherever you are is the place I belong;Cause I wanna be free,, and I wanna be young;I will never look back now I'm ready to run;I'm ready to run;;[Verse 3: Niall Horan];There's a future in my life I can't foresee;Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me;;[Verse 4: Louis Tomlinson];There will always be the kind that criticize;But I know,, yes I know we'll be alright;;[Chorus];;[Bridge: Zayn Malik];This time I'm ready to run;Id give everything that Ive got for your love;;[Chorus]
