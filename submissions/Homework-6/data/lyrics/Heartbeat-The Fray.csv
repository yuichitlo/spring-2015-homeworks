;[Verse 1];We're on an open bed truck on the highway;The rain is coming down and we're on the run;Think I can feel the breath in your body;We gotta keep on running 'til we see the sun;;[Pre-Chorus];Oh you got a fire and it's burning in the rain;Thought that it went out,, but it's burning just the same;And you don't look back,, not for anything;Cause if you love someone,, you love them all the same;If you love someone,, you love them all the same;;[Chorus];Oh,, I feel your heartbeat;And you're coming around,, coming around,, coming around;If you can love somebody,, love them all the same;You gotta love somebody,, love them all the same;Singing,, oh,, I feel your heartbeat;;[Verse 2];I'm trying to put it all back together;I've got a story and I'm trying to tell it right;I got the kerosene and a desire;I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Ooh,, ooh;I know the memories are rushing into mind;I wanna kiss your scars tonight,, baby;Cause you gotta try;You gotta let me in;Let me in;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Oh yeah,, oh yeah;Heartbeat
