;[Intro: Rebecca Black];Oh my god,, I love this song;This is my jam;Where is my peanut butter?;;[Verse 1: Rebecca Black];2 PM,, getting out of my bed;Trying to get Friday out of my head;It's all so hazy;Got a little too crazy;You know I'd do it all again;;[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black];Call everyone you know;Turn up the radio;Cause this is our song;We can do no wrong;Are you ready,, are you ready to go?;;[Chorus: Rebecca Black];This Saturday we're gonna party all night;One we will remember the rest of our lives;This Saturday we're gonna do it bigger than we ever have before;;I don't want this Saturday to end [x3];;[Interlude: Rebecca Black &amp,; (Dave Days)];(Hello?);Hey,, come over;(Alright,, alright,, I'll be right over. I just gotta find my pants.);;[Verse 2: Dave Days];Rolling up,, I'm on the scene;Want you here right next to me;Yeah,, cause this is our night;Ain't got no deadlines;There's nowhere else I'd rather be;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge: Rebecca Black];Yesterday was Friday,, today is Saturday;We're gonna live like there's no tomorrow;Wouldn't have it any other way;;[Chorus]
