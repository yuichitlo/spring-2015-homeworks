;[Verse 1];Girl I finally got you up in the seat of my old truck;And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do;We could hit the county line,, hell we do that all the time;Tell you what if you don't mind,, we could start with something new;Instead of waiting like we usually do;;[Chorus];It started with a goodnight kiss,, my lips,, your lips;Baby let's just keep gettin' there;It started with a long goodbye,, get wrapped up tight;Let's spend all night right here;It started with a goodnight kiss;;[Verse 2];I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them;I can call 'em all again and tell them we ain't coming;Let me find a little spot,, let me throw this thing apart;Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do;Just tell me that you want to;;[Chorus];;It started with a goodnight kiss;;[Bridge];I don't wanna wait,, I don't wanna wait;It started with a goodnight kiss;My lips,, your lips;;[Chorus];;It started with a goodnight kiss;;[Outro];I don't wanna wait,, no I don't wanna wait
