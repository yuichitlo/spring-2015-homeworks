;I turn the TV off,, to turn it on again;Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around;Counting every crack,, the clock is wide awake;Talking to myself,, anything to make a sound;;I told you I wouldnt call,, I told you I wouldnt care;But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere;I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder;Come over,, come over,, come over,, come over,, come over;;You can say were done the way you always do;Its easier to lie to me than to yourself;Forget about your friends,, you know theyre gonna say;Were bad for each other,, but we aint good for anyone else;;I told you I wouldnt call,, I told you I wouldnt care;But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere;I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder;Come over,, come over,, come over,, come over,, come over;;We dont have to miss each other,, come over;We dont have to fix each other,, come over;We dont have to say forever,, come over;You dont have to stay forever,, come over;;I told you I wouldnt call,, I told you I wouldnt care;But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere;I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder;Come over,, come over,, come over,, come over,, come over;;Come over,, come over,, come over,, come over,, come over;Come over,, come over,, come over,, come over,, come over;;Songwriter:  Sam Hunt
