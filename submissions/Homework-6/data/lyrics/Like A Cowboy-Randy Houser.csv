;Every time I fall I get back up again;Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind;Let it take me where it wants to go;Another one horse town,, another damned old rodeo;;I know this life is crazy;But I'll be home soon baby;;I'll ride in on a sunny day;Sing you a song,, steal your heart away;Like a cowboy;Hang my hat like I'm here for a while;Kick off my boots and drive you wild;Like a cowboy;Well baby you know I can't stay long;You wake up,, I'll be gone;Until then I'll hold on;Like a cowboy;;I keep your picture tucked inside my old hat;It brings me luck,, I need a bunch of that;This midnight winding road runs through my blood;I can't give it up,, like I said I would;;I know it's hard on you;But like I always do;;I'll ride in on a sunny day;Sing you a song,, steal your heart away;Like a cowboy;Hang my hat like I'm here for a while;Kick off my boots and drive you wild;Like a cowboy;Well baby you know I can't stay long;You wake up,, I'll be gone;Until then I'll hold on;Like a cowboy;;I'll ride in on a sunny day;Sing you a song,, steal your heart away;Like a cowboy;Hang my hat like I'm here for a while;Kick off my boots and drive you wild;Like a cowboy;Like a cowboy;Like a cowboy;Like a cowboy;;Every time I fall I get back up again;Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
