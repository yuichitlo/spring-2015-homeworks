;[Chorus];I got bills I gotta pay;So I'm gon' work work work every day;I got mouths I gotta feed;So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats;I got bills;;[Verse 1];All these bills piled up on my desk;They looking like a mountain (Everest);All the little kids runnin' 'round you can hear their stomachs growlin';There's a full moon out,, and my girl just keep on howlin';Says she gon' leave me if I don't come home with 50 thousand (50 thousand?);;[Refrain];God damn,, god damn,, god damn;Oh man,, oh man,, oh man;God damn,, oh man,, god damn,, oh man;;[Chorus];;[Verse 2];Woke up and I bumped my head;Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed;Opened the fridge and the food all gone;Neighbor's damn dog done crapped on my lawn;Hopped in the car and the car won't start;It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk;Behind an old lady in the grocery line;Praying that my card don't get declined;;[Refrain] + [Chorus];;[Bridge];And my shoes,, my shoes;I said my shoes!;Ain't got no soul;;[Chorus] x2
