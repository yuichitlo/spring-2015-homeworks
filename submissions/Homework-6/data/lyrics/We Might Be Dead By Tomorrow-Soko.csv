;Give me all your love now;Cause for all we know;We might be dead by tomorrow;;I can't go on wasting my time;Adding scars to my heart;Cause all I hear is I'm not ready enough;;And I can tell that you didn't have;To face your mother,, losing her love;Without saying goodbye;Without saying goodbye;Cause she didn't have time;;I don't want to judge what's in your heart;But if you're not ready for love;How can you be ready for life?;How can you be ready for life?;;So let's love fully and let's love loud;And let's love now;Cause soon enough we'll die;Cause soon enough we'll die;Cause soon enough we'll die;Cause soon enough we'll die;Cause soon enough we'll die;Cause soon enough we'll die
