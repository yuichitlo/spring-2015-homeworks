;[Verse 1];She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene;I said don't mind,, but what do you mean I am the one;Who will dance on the floor in the round;She said I am the one,, who will dance on the floor in the round;She told me her name was Billie Jean;As she caused a scene;Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one;Who will dance on the floor in the round;;[Bridge 1];People always told me be careful of what you do;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts;And mother always told me be careful of who you love;And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth;;[Chorus];Billie Jean is not my lover;She's just a girl who claims that I am the one;But the kid is not my son;She says I am the one,, but the kid is not my son;;[Verse 2];For fourty days and for forty nights;The law was on her side;But who can stand when she's in demand;Her schemes and plans;Cause we danced on the floor in the round;So take my strong advice,, just remember to always think twice;Do think twice (heeee);She told my baby we'd danced till three,, then she looked at me;Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh,, no!);Cause we danced on the floor in the round,, baby;;[Bridge 2];People always told me be careful of what you do;And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts;She came and stood right by me;Then the smell of sweet perfume;This happened much too soon;She called me to her room;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Billie Jean Is Not My Lover;Billie Jean Is Not My Lover;Billie Jean Is Not My Lover;Billie Jean Is Not My Lover;Billie Jean Is Not My Lover;Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
