;[Intro];I just wanna;;[Verse 1];It's in the air;The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare;Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there;With every hit I take,, you move that waist and I wanna die;A girl like you,, adore;The way you drop that thing could start another war;And my hands are gettin' eager to explore;Cherry lips are singin' Purple Rain and I feel alive;;[Pre-Chorus];I take the wheel and grab the clutch;Your body should be mine to touch;I fit the rhythm your body's givin';And once I get in there;;[Chorus];She got the smoothest ride;Like velvet all inside;Her sex just changed my life;She rides like a dream;And damn that velvet looks good on me;;[Verse 2];I feel the heat;Every drop of you is rainin' down on me;You're perfection's foggin' up my window seat;I got your body switchin' all positions through the night;;[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus];;[Outro] x4;She rides like a dream;Velvet looks good on me
