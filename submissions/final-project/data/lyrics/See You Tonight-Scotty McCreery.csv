;[Verse 1];Girl,, you know I love talking to you on the phone;I could listen to your sweet voice all night long;Sometimes I can get by with a sweet dreams baby good night;But this time,, well,, I don't wanna spend it alone;;[Chorus 1];So I'm coming over,, I hope it's alright;Listen for me pulling into your drive;Look out your window - you'll see my lights;Baby girl,, I gotta see you tonight;The way the breeze is blowing,, blowing;Got me wishing I was holding,, holding;Holding you so tight under that porch light;But girl,, I gotta see you tonight,, tonight,, tonight;Girl,, I gotta see you tonight,, tonight,, tonight;;[Verse 2];I got a couple hundred pictures of your pretty face;On my phone,, on my dash - all over the place;But I would drive a million miles;Just to see that little smile in real life;Baby,, it's worth the drive;You're worth the drive;;[Chorus 1];;[Verse 3];No,, I don't care what time it is;I just gotta get a little moonlight kiss;Girl,, I can't help it when I feel like this;There's only one thing to do;Baby,, I'm missing you;;[Chorus 1]
