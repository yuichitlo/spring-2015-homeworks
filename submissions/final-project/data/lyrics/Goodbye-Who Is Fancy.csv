;[Verse 1;I was a hot mess,, in my Sunday best;Black tears in my eyes;You were my first love,, you were my only one;I can't believe your lies;;[Pre-Chorus 1];Once we were like bottle rockets;Now I know I have to stop it;Please believe me,, this isn't easy;I just need to say goodbye;;[Chorus];Goodbye,, goodbye;Losing my mind;Goodbye;;[Verse 2];You got a new friend,, you like to play pretend;I'm just keeping my cool;Turn on that smoke machine,, magic and make believe;She'll never know you like I do;;[Pre-Chorus 2];Once we were like fire burning;Now you're just a lesson I'm learning;Please believe me,, this isn't easy;I just need to say goodbye;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I know that I can find somebody;You won't ever find nobody else like me;;[Pre-Chorus 1];;[Chorus]
