;[Verse 1];So much pressure,, why so loud?;If you don't like my sound you can turn it down;I got a road,, and I walk it alone;Uphill battle,, I look good when I climb;I'm ferocious,, precocious I get braggadocios;I'm not gonna stop,, I like the view from the top;;[Pre-Hook 1];You talk that blah blah;That la la,, that rah rah shit;And I'm so done,, I'm so over it;Sometimes I mess up,, I eff up,, I hit and miss;But I'm okay,, I'm cool with it;;[Hook];I still fall on my face sometimes;And I,, can't colour inside the lines;Cause,, I'm perfectly incomplete;I'm still working on my masterpiece;And I,, I wanna hang with the greatest;Got a way to go,, but it's worth the wait;No,, you haven't seen the best of me;I'm still working on my masterpiece;;[Verse 2];Those who mind don't matter;Those who matter don't mind;If you don't catch what I'm throwing;Then I leave you behind;Gone in a flash;And I am living like that,, yeah;;[Pre-Hook 2];They talk that blah blah;That la la,, that rah rah shit;Go with the punches,, and take the hits;Sometimes I mess up,, I eff up,, I swing and miss;But it's okay,, I'm cool with it;;[Hook] (x3)
