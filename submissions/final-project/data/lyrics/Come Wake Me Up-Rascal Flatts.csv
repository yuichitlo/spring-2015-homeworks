;[Verse 1];I can usually drink you right off of my mind;But I miss you tonight;I can normally push you right out of my heart;But I'm too tired to fight;Yeah the whole thing begins;And I let you sink into my veins;And I feel the pain like it's new;Everything that we were;Everything that you said;Everything that I did and that I couldn't do;Plays through tonight;;[Chorus];Tonight your memory burns like a fire;With every one it grows higher and higher;And I can't get over it;I just can't put out this love;I just sit in these flames;And pray that you'll come back;Close my eyes tightly,, hold on and;Hope that I'm dreaming;Come wake me up;;[Verse 2];Turn the TV up loud;Just to drown out your voice;But I can't forget;Now I'm all out of ideas and baby;I'm down to my last cigarette;Yeah,, you're probably asleep;Deep inside of your dreams;While Im sitting here;Crying and trying to;See,, yeah,, wherever you are;Baby now I am sure you moved on;And aren't thinking twice about me;And you tonight;;[Chorus];;I know that you're movin' on;I know I should give you up;But I keep hopin' that you'll trip;And fall back in love;Time's not healin' anything;Baby,, this pain is worse than it ever was;I know that you can't hear me;But baby I need you to save me tonight;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Oh,, I'm dreaming;Come wake me up;Oh,, I'm dreaming
