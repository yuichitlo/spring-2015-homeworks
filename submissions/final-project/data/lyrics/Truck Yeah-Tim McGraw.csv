;[Verse 1];Got Little Wayne pumping on my iPod;Thumping on the subs in the back of my crew cab;Redneck rocking like a rockstar;Sling a little mud off the back,, we can do that;Friday night football,, Saturday Last Call,, Sunday Hallelujah;If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud;Then you know what I'm talking about;;[Chorus];Let me hear you say,, Truck Yeah;Wanna get it jacked up yeah;Let's crank it on up yeah;With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah;We can love it on up yeah;'Till the sun comes up yeah;And if you think this life I love is a little too country;Truck Yeah;;[Verse 2];Our party in the club is a honky tonk downtown;Yeah that's where I like to hang out;Chilling in the back room;Hanging with my whole crew;Sipping on a cold brew,, hey now!;Got a mixed up playlist,, DJ play this;Wanna hear a country song;If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud;Throw your hands up now,, let me hear you shout;;[Chorus];Truck Yeah;Wanna get it jacked up yeah;Let's crank it on up yeah;With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah;We can love it on up yeah;'Till the sun comes up yeah;And if you think this life I love is a little too country;Truck Yeah;;[Verse 3];Rap or country,, city,, farm;It don't matter who you are;Got a little fight,, got a little love;Got a little redneck in your blood;Are you one of us?;;;[Chorus]
