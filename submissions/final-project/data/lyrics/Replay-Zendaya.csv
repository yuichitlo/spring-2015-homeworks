;[Verse 1];Make it stop;Sounds so good,, I just can't sing no more;Turn it down,, turn it up;I don't know;I don't know,, know!;But don't stop,, don't move;Just keep it there,, right there;Keep it right there;Keep it right there;;[Pre-Chorus];I wanna hit you on repeat;Play you everywhere I go,, everywhere I go,, play you everywhere I go;Put you on repeat,, play you everywhere I go,, everywhere I go,, play you everywhere I go;;[Hook];Yeah-ay;Wanna put this song on replay;I can listen to it all day;I can listen to you all day,, yeah you all day;Yeah-ay;Wanna put this song on replay;We can start all over again,, and again;Yeah;Wanna put this song on replay;;[Verse 2];Don't stop;Turn it on,, turn it up;Make it louder;Don't wanna miss a single thing;I wanna hear every melody,, yeah;B-b-b-beat it;Beat it so loud you could feel it;B-b-b-beat it;Beat it for you;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];You it all off;Till it all crashing down;I'm so lost;I'm so lost in your sound;;[Chorus]
