;[Verse 1: Adam Levine];Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies;Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see;Take my hand,, let's see where we wake up tomorrow;Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand;I'll be damned,, Cupid's demanding back his arrow;So let's get drunk on our tears and;;[Chorus: Adam Levine];God,, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young;It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run;Searching for meaning,, but are we all lost stars;Trying to light up the dark?;;[Verse 2: Adam Levine];Who are we? Just a spec of dust within the galaxy;Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality;Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow;Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer;Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending;Where we're dancing in our tears and;;[Chorus: Adam Levine];;[Bridge: Adam Levine];I thought I saw you out there crying,, ooh;And I thought I heard you call my name,, yeah;And I thought I heard you out there crying,, oh;Just the same,, oh,, yeah;;[Chorus: Adam Levine];;[Bridge];;[Outro];But are we all lost stars,, trying to light up the dark?;But are we all lost stars,, trying to light up the dark?
