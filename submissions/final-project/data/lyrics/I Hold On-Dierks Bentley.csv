;[Verse 1];It's just an old beat up truck;Some say that I should trade up;Now that I got some jangle in my pocket;But what they dont understand;Is it's the miles that make a man;I wouldnt trade that thing in for a rocket;What they dont know is my dad and me;We drove her out to Tennessee;And shes still here and now hes gone;So I hold on;It's just an old beat up box;Its rusty strings across the top;It probably dont look like much to you;But these dents and scratches in the wood;Yeah,, thats what makes it sound so good;To me it's better than brand new;You see this here flat top guitar;Has had my back in a million bars;Singing every country song;So I hold on;;[Chorus];To the things I believe in;My faith,, your love,, our freedom;To the things I can count on;To keep me going strong;Yeah,, I hold on,, I hold on;Like the stripes to the flag;Like a boy to his dad;I can't change who I am,, right or wrong;So I hold on;;[Verse 2];Yeah,, baby,, looking at you right now;There ain't never been no doubt;Without you I'd be nothing;So if you ever worry about;Me walking out;Yeah,, let me tell you something;I hold on;I hold on;Can you hear me,, baby?;I hold on;Yeah;I hold on...;;[Chorus]
