;[Verse 1];On truck bed,, hop in it,, fire engine red like a lipstick;Out here we can let it go,, yeah;Just me and my good friends,, jug of wine lil' sip;Out here baby you just never know;Yeah,, these are the days of gold;;[Chorus];Well it's a Southern summer;Whiskey's in the air,, dog's on the burner;Beer's ice cold,, got a pretty little lady to hold;Southern summer;And that sun shining down like Daddy's silver dollar;Gotta hop on the old dirt road to the days of gold;;[Verse 2];The July sky,, so high moon shining by the river side;Stealing hearts and running wild;In our own little world,, Tennessee boys and girls running free;Out here it's good times for miles;Yeah,, these are the days of gold;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];A little bit of you,, a little bit of me;What you want to do,, what's it going to be;We can get a wild,, we can live free;Or you can shake it for me baby like a tambourine;Slice the watermelon and you spit the seed;Sweat on your back's sticking to the seat;We can sneak off to beat the heat;I'll be buzzing on you honey like a bumble bee;;[Chorus]
