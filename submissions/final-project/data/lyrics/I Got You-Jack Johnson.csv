;[Verse 1];Back when all my little goals seemed so important;Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion;Heaven was a place still in space not in motion;But soon;;[Chorus];I got you;I got everything,, Ive got you;I dont need nothing more than you;I got everything,, Ive got you;;[Verse 2];We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know;Maybe if we save them we could build a little home;But then the hailstorm came,, it yelled;You need to let go,, you got no control;No;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];This weights too much alone;Some days I cant hold it at all;You take it on for me;When tomorrows too much Ill carry it all;I got you;Yea when tomorrows too much Ill carry it all;I got you;;[Chorus]
