;Damn,, I used to love this view;Sit here and drink a few;Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night;Down there it's another touchdown;Man,, this year's team is stout;I can hear them going crazy;And up here so am I;Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this,, I hate it;If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it,, take it;;Give me back my hometown;Cause this is my hometown;;All the colors of my youth;The red,, the green,, the hope,, the truth;Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene;My friends try to cheer me up get together at the Pizza Hut;I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place;These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street;Shed a light on everything that used to be;;Give me back my hometown;Cause this is my hometown;Yeah,, yeah,, oh,, yeah,, yeah;;You can have my grandma's locket;The knife out of my grandpa's pocket;Yeah my state champion jacket;I don't care you can have it;Every made memory;Every picture,, every broken dream;Yeah everything,, everything,, everything;;Give me back my hometown;Cause this is my hometown;Yeah,, yeah,, oh,, yeah,, yeah;;Songwriter:  Eric Church and Luke Laird
