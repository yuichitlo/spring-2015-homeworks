;[Verse 1: Trevor Guthrie];Nobody here knocking at my door;The sound of silence I cant take anymore;Nobody ringing my telephone now;Oh how I miss such a beautiful sound;;[Hook: Trevor Guthrie];And I dont even know how I survive;I wont make it to the shore without your light;No I dont even know if Im alive;Oh,, oh,, oh without you now;This is what it feels like;;[Verse 2: Trevor Guthrie];Nothing to hold but the memories and frames;Oh they remind me of the battle I face;Without your love,, without you I drown;Somebody save me Im going down;;[Hook: Trevor Guthrie];And I dont even know how I survive;I wont make it to the shore without your light;No I dont even know if Im alive;Oh,, oh,, oh without you now;This is what it feels like;;[Hook: Trevor Guthrie];And I dont even know how I survive;I wont make it down the road with one headlight;No I dont even know if Im alive;Oh,, oh,, oh without you now;This is what it feels like
