;[Verse 1];If I could be the reason your hair's a mess;The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest;If I could be the voice on your radio;Then I could be your long ride home;;[Verse 2];If mine could be the name that changes yours;The wine in your glass;The swing on your porch;The dollar in your pocket;And the peaceful in your sleep;Then I'd be what you mean to me;;[Chorus];Standing here;Watching you;Turning every head in this crowded room;The lights down low;Dancing slow;Oh,, if falling's how you feel;And perfect's what you see;Then I'd be what you mean to me;;[Verse 3];If I could be the fire in your firefly;The cool in the rain;The spark in your eye;The answer to your prayer;And the faith that sets you free;Then I'd be what you mean to me;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And oh;All of this talkin makes you laugh;But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Yea;Falling's how you feel;And perfect's what you see;Then I'd be what you mean to me;Be what you mean to me;Ohhhhh,, be what you mean,, what you mean,, what you mean,, what you mean to me
