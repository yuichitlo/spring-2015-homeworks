;[Verse 1];There ain't nothing like them first loves,, baby;Remember them high school days;Friday nights come abd dances;Giving my old letterman's jacket away;To hold us a name;But now it's you and me talking on the phone till 4 AM;About anything and everything;Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed;Ain't a damn thing changed;;[Chorus];Makes me want to sneak down your driveway;To climb out your window;Get in girl,, we'll roll until the dirt road ends;You can climb up in that backseat;With your pretty little bare feet;Get the butterflies like we used to;Got our innocence;Just like we're 17 again;;[Verse 2];I thought them feelings was long gone,, baby;But you take me back in time;Just like spring break in Panama City;Girl from Indiana sure was pretty;But she ain't got nothing on you tonight;Because you're like the summer loving don't come or go;Never had to say goodbye;I wake up in the morning feeling like a first kiss;Every time your lips touch mine;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Looking back I wish I could put you inside every memory;(Every memory);You can be my first love;My first kiss;My first and last everything;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Yeah just like we're 17 again;17 Again;Oh
