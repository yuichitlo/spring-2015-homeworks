;[Verse 1];When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton;The first time you leave it can be strange,, it can be shocking;Not everybody drives a truck,, not everybody drinks sweet tea;Not everybody owns a gun,, wears a ball cap,, boots,, and jeans;Not everybody goes to church,, or watches every NASCAR race;Not everybody knows the words to Ring Of Fire or Amazing Grace;;[Chorus];Oh,, Dixie Land;I hope you understand;When I miss my Tennessee home;And I've been away way too long;I can't see this world unless I go;Outside my southern comfort zone;;[Verse 2];I have walked the streets of Rome,, I have been to foreign lands;I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand;I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night;I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights;I know what it's like to be the only one like me;To take a good hard look around and be a minority;;[Chorus];And I miss my Tennessee home;I can see the ways that I've grown;I can't see this world unless I go;Outside my southern comfort zone;;[Bridge];I miss your biscuits and your gravy;Fireflies dancing in the night;You have fed me,, you have saved me;Billy Graham and Martha White;I have since become a drifter;And I just can't wait to pack;Cause I know the route I leave on;It will always bring me back;;[Guitar Solo];;[Chorus];I wish I was in Dixie Again;I miss my Tennessee Home;I've been away way too long;I can't see this world unless I go;Outside my southern comfort zone;;[Outro];Look away,, look away;;I wish I was in Dixie,, away,, look away
