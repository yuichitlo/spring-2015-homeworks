;[Verse 1];Did you know that you could be wrong;And swear youre right?;Some people been known to do it;All their lives;But you find yourself alone;Just like you found yourself before;Like I found myself in pieces;On the hotel floor;Hard times help me see;;[Chorus];Im a good man with a good heart;Had a tough time,, got a rough start;But I finally learned to let it go;Now Im right here,, and Im right now;And Im hoping,, knowing somehow;That my shadow days are over;My shadow days are over now;;[Verse 2];Well I'm no trouble maker;And I never meant her harm;But it doesnt mean I didnt make it;Hard to carry on;Well it sucks to be honest (honest);And it hurts to be real;But it's nice to make some love;That I can finally feel;Hard times let me be;;[Chorus][x2]
