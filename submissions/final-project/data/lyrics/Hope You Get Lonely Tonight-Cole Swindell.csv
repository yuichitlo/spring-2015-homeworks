;[Verse 1];I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss;Baby taste the moonshinin' off of your lips;I want to see that 'want ya' smile;Still got me hooked,, been hooked for awhile;If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet;And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed;If you got some room for a little regret;Let me know girl I've already left...;;[Chorus];If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up;You got my number baby hit me up;If you need a little late night pick me up;I,, hope you get lonely tonight;We ain't gotta make up,, just kiss me;We could straight up blame it on the whiskey;You ain't gotta wake up and miss me,, no;I hope you get lonely tonight;;[Verse 2];I don't care if you're spinnin' in the neon;Or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on;Either way the thought is turning me on;And I can't shake it girl I'm wide awake,, so;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Hope you get lonely;Hope you get lonely;Hope you get lonely tonight;Girl;;[Chorus];;Lonely tonight;Lonely tonight;Yep girl,, I hope you get lonely tonight
