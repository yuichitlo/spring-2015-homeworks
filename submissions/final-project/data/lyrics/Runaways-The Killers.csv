;[Verse 1];Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind;A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand;I'd been on her trail for a little while;But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand;A teenage rush;She said,, Aren't we all just runaways? We got time;But that is not much;We can't wait till tomorrow;You got to know that this is real,, baby,, why you want to fight it?;It's the one thing you can choose,, oh!;;[Verse 2];We got engaged on a Friday night;I swore on the head of our unborn child;That I could take care of the three of us;But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild;It's in my blood;She said she might just runaway somewhere else;Someplace good;We can't wait til tomorrow;You got to know that this is real,, baby,, why you want to fight it?;It's the one thing you can choose;Let's take a chance baby,, we can't lose;;[Verse 3];Isn't we all just runaways?;I knew it when I met you,, I'm not going to let you runaway;I knew it when I held you,, I wasn't letting go!;;[Verse 4];We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams;Hold each other till the morning light;We used to laugh,, now we only fight;Baby are you lonesome now?;;[Verse 5];At night I come home after they go to sleep;Like a stumbling a ghost,, I haunt these halls;There's a picture of us on our wedding day;I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls;;[Verse 6];We can't wait till tomorrow;Oh we're caught up in the appeal baby,, why you wanna hide it?;It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?);I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive;;;[Outro];Oh! Oh! Oh!;;Aren't we all just runaways?;Yeah,, runaways;Aren't we all just runaways?;Yeah
