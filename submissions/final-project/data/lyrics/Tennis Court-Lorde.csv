;[Produced by Joel Little];;[Verse 1];Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?;Making smart with their words again,, well I'm bored;Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it,, killin' it;Never not chasing a million things I want;And I am only as young as the minute is,, full of it;Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought;But I know they'll never own me (Yeah);;[Chorus];Baby be the class clown,, I'll be the beauty queen in tears;It's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah);We're so happy,, even when we're smilin' out of fear;Let's go down to the tennis court,, and talk it up like yeah (Yeah);;[Verse 2];Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane;I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space;But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games,,up in flames;How can I fuck with the fun again,, when I'm known?;And my boys trip me up with their heads again,, loving them;Everything's cool when we're all in line,, for the throne;But I know it's not forever (Yeah);;[Chorus];;[Bridge];It looked alright in the pictures;Getting caught's half of the trip though,, isn't it?;I fall apart,, with all my heart;And you can watch from your window (2x);;[Chorus];;[Outro];And talk it up like yeah (2x);Let's go down to the tennis court,, and talk it up like yeah;And talk it up like yeah (2x);Let's go down to the tennis court,, and talk it up like yeah (Yeah)
