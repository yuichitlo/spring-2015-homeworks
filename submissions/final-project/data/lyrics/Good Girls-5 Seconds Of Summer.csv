;[Verse 1];She's a good girl,, she's Daddy's favorite;He's saved for Harvard,, (he knows she'll make it);She's good at school,, she's never truant;She can speak French,, (and I think she's fluent);;Cause every night she studies hard in her room;(At least that's what her parents assume);But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend;Here's what she told me the time that I caught her...;;[Chorus];She said to me,, forget what you thought;Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught;So just turn around and forget what you saw;Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught;Ohhhhh,, Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught... x2;;[Verse 2];She's a good girl;A straight A-student;She's really into all that self-improvement;(I swear she lives in that library);But if you ask her she'll say;(That's where you'll find me!);;But if you're looking,, you won't find her there;She may be clever but she just acts too square;In the back of the room,, where nobody looks;She'll be with her boyfriend.. she's not reading books;;[Chorus];;[Bridge] x2;She's a good girl,, hasn't been caught..;She's a good girl,, hasn't been caught...;;[Chorus x2];;[Outro x2];Whoa;Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught...
