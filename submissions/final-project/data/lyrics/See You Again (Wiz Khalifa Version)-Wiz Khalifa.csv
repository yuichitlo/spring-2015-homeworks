;[Hook: Chris Brown];It's been a long day without you my friend;And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again;We've come a long way from where we began;And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again;When I see you again;;[Verse 1: Tyga];Looking back now,, know you hear me,, wanna see me smile;Hold me down,, keep me safe,, when I'm down,, not a sound;Ever since you was a child,, always had your back til now;Shoulda kept the circle round,, now it's like you not around;Used to run it through the town,, toughest little dudes around;Always thought you had a daughter,, sure to teach her what they taught us;Had a son he getting smarter,, every day more like his father;Know this game and keep us silent,, prayers and faith,, know you got it;Big things come back again,, but it ain't the same;I tell myself remain the same and keep your sane;Know it's hard when your dawg ain't there to bark with ya;Seems like yesterday we was all in pictures;;[Hook];;[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa];First you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling stronger;Was small turned to a friendship,, a friendship turned to a bond;And that bond will never be broken,, the love will never get lost;And when brotherhood come first and the line will never be crossed;Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn;And that line is what we reach over,, remember me when I'm gone;How can we not talk about family when family's all that we've got;Everything I would do,, you were standing there by my side;And now ou gon' be there for the last ride;;[Hook]
