;[Verse 1];You call me out upon the waters;The great unknown where feet may fail;And there I find You in the mystery;In oceans deep;My faith will stand;;[Chorus];And I will call upon Your name;And keep my eyes above the waves;When oceans rise;My soul will rest in Your embrace;For I am Yours and You are mine;;[Verse 2];Your grace abounds in deepest waters;Your sovereign hand;Will be my guide;Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me;You've never failed and You won't start now;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3] (x6);Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders;Let me walk upon the waters;Wherever You would call me;Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander;And my faith will be made stronger;In the presence of my Savior;;[Chorus]
