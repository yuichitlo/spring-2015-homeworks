;[Verse 1];I'm the kind of girl;Who doesn't say a word;Who sits at the curb;And waits for the world;But I'm about to break out,, about to break out;I'm like a crook tonight;;I caught you staring at me;And I was thinking clearly;Now I'm like a bee;And I'm hunting for the honey;And I'm kinda shy,, but,, you're super fly,, yeah;I could be your Kryptonite;;Like Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh;Light my heart up baby,, like a matchstick;Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh oOh;And hit the gas quick;;[Chorus];Ready or Not ,, here I come;Where you at? The night is young;In the crowd the music's loud;But I will find you;;Ready or Not ,, here I come;I like your face,, do you like my song ?;Just sing it la la la la la la la;And I find you;Ready or Not ,, Ready or Not;;[Verse 2];Hello,, my name is (Bridgit);Nice to meet you;I think you're famous;Where have I seen you?;You'll be my William,, I'll be your Kate;Living like a fairytale;;We could have a palace;Right next to Oprah;37 Cars and a yacht;Down in boca;Take me away ,, wherever you say ,, yeah we could be setting sail;;Like Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh;Light my heart up baby ,, like a matchstick;Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh oOh;And hit the gas quick;;[Chorus];Ready or Not ,, here I come;Where you at? The night is young;In the crowd the music's loud;But I will find you;;Ready or Not ,, here I come;I like your face,, do you like my song ?;Just sing it la la la la la la la;And I find you;Ready or Not ,, Ready or Not;;[Hook];Ready or not ,, here I come ,, here I come;You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs;You and me dance from the night to the dawn;Ready or not ,, here I come boy ,, It's on;;Ready or not ,, here I come ,, here I come;You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs;You and me dance from the night to the dawn;Ready or not ,, here I come boy ,, It's on;;[Chorus];Ready or Not ,, here I come;Where you at? The night is young;In the crowd the music's loud;But I will find you;;Ready or Not ,, here I come;I like your face,, do you like my song ?;Just sing it la la la la la la la;And I find you;Ready or Not;;Ready or not;(You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs);Ready Or not;(ooooooh);Ready or Not;(ready or not ,, whoa );Ready or Not;(ready or not,, ready or not or not or not not );Ready or Not
