I'll wear it with pride,, and I promise to respect all it represents as long as I live.;;It's an honor to join Steve Largent and Cortez Kennedy.  As the third player to represent the Seahawks franchise and the 12th Man. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been thinking about this day ever since Cortez came into this enshrinement two years ago.  Walter Jones,, you're next.;;Steve,, you have set the standard for all Seahawks to follow.  And Cortez,, you showed us all what it's like to be a professional and a real Hall of Famer.  To you both,, I plan to pay your graciousness forward.  Believe me,, I have an attitude of gratitude for so many people who helped me become who I am,, and today I want to share with you who I am.;;I grew up in Aliceville,, Alabama.  The seventh of eight kids and the fourth son to a wonderful woman.  My family means the world to me.  We may not have had much,, but Mom always made sure we had everything we needed.  With eight kids,, that can be tough.  Occasionally the power would go out or we might not have enough food in the morning.  But understand something,, we were never in the dark and never went to bed hungry.  That is a true testament to my mother Earline Jones.;;Mama,, I love you.  Thank you for all your hard work,, determination,, and perseverance.  No matter how tough things got,, you treated us the right way.  Mama,, I remember many nights hearing you cry and pray.  Now as I stand here,, I can say that prayer does have the power of change.  You always supported me and the decisions I made.  Speaking for the rest of my siblings,, you should take such pride in the family you raised.  You're the real Hall of Famer.  You set such an example for your kids and grandkids.  We all love you so much.  Thank you.;;To my brothers and sisters,, you all have been so important to me.  I love you.  To my oldest sister,, Beverly,, thank you for the gifts and the big sister love.  I do remember,, you've always been there.  To my oldest brother,, Cornelius,, you are the father figure in my life.  Thanks for taking care of us when Mom was working those long hours.;;To Gwen,, the party starter. You kept me up to all the great music when I was young. You were so cool. When you would break curfew,, I was the one that unlocked the door. Sorry,, Mom.;;To Danny,, the first to leave the nest and go off and join the Army,, thank you.  You showed me you could leave Aliceville and become something.  Like all the men and women who serve our country,, you are a true hero.;;To Valeria,, you are the true spirit of Mom.

Muh Dear kept the sweet tea flowing,, and left me with some great family memories.  Granddad had a strong work ethic which he instilled in me,, and I know I've done him proud.  I helped him with the chores and in the garden.  But he always left us enough time to be kids and enjoy the summer.;;Wayne Jones was like a brother to me.  I loved summers with him.  I learned from them that if you want it,, you can get it,, and nothing comes between family.  We love family no matter what.  My football journey began in Aliceville High School,, as an oversized ninth grader.  Coach Pierce Macintosh approached me and asked me have you ever played football or thought about playing?  Which I hadn't.  He immediately took me to the fields. Afterwards,, I said,, what do you think?  He said,, I think you're a million dollars walking around broke.  Coach,, you saw something in me that I didn't see in myself.  You pushed me and believed in me.  You came along at a perfect time in my life.  You taught me discipline and work ethic.  Your motto,, better is possible,, and good is not enough.  Everything I learned from you in high school,, I used in my pro career.  I hope I made you proud.

Whatever you told us,, we believed,, and everybody followed your lead.  Randy Mueller and Mickey Loomis drafted me and forever changed my life.  A special shout out to Mike Reinfeldt for all those contract battles you made with my agent Roosevelt Barnes.  Being franchised really helped define my character and my career.  Missing training camp wasn't bad either.;;Roosevelt,, thanks for believing in me,, looking out for me,, and keeping me grounded and focused.  You told me to handle my business on the field and you would take care of the rest.  You began as my agent,, but ended up my brother.;;To Shelly Schmidt,, the assistant of all assistants.  You have been nothing but wonderful.  Thank you.  My teammates and their friendships have been such a huge part of my success.
