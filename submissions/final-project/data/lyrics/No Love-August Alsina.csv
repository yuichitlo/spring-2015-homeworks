;[Intro];She said she want to stay together;I don't think I can oooh;;[Verse 1];Red light;You know I can't make this thing that official;Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you shit;You don't like that I make this easy,, leaving;After sexing on the floor;Baby I know you need me,, like I need you;But I'm not the one you wanna love;;[Hook];So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me;Loving ain't the same with a nigga like;You use to them but ain't no loving me;I hear what you would say and girl it's clear to see;You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me;You probably go insane with a nigga like me;Let's just party till we can't,, ain't no loving me;And I'm the one to blame,, ain't no loving me;So don't come looking for love;;No love x9;Don't come looking for love;No love x9;;[Verse 2];Shawty if you looking for somebody tryna settle down;Probably won't be around nah baby;You should hit when you tired of playing up in the house;And ain't nobody around;You need that;When you need that late night;We can both make love to the daylight;You got it girl,, you got it girl;But you know I can't stay right? Uh nah babe;All I want is you so what you tryna do?;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Until the morning we can freak but baby girl you gotta know,, know,, know;We can rubble in these sheets but after this you gotta go,, go,, go;Don't take it personal;When it feel so good we can get emotional;But that is when you find out that it hurts the most;Since then I've always been like trust nobody show no love;;[Hook]
