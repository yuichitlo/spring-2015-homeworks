;[Verse 1];I was on a heavy tip;Try'na cross a canyon with a broken limb;You were on the other side,, like always;Wondering what to do with life;;[Verse 2];I'd already had a sip;So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it;You were on the other side,, like always;You could never make your mind;;[Pre-Chorus];And with one kiss;You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years;What kind of man loves like this?;;[Verse 3];To let me dangle at a cruel angle;Oh,, my feet don't touch the floor;Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out;But you never close the door;;[Chorus];What kind of man loves like this?;What kind of man?;What kind of man loves like this?;What kind of man?;;[Verse 4];You're a holy fool,, all coloured blue;Red feet upon the floor;You do such damage,, how do you manage?;Trying to crawl in back for more;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Verse 5];But I can't beat ya,, cause I'm still with ya;Oh mercy,, I implore (Oh mercy,, I implore);How do you do it? I think I'm through it;Then I'm back against the wall;;[Chorus] (x2)
