;[Verse 1];Said goodbye,, turned around;And you were gone,, gone,, gone;Faded into the setting sun;Slipped away;But I wont cry;Cause I know Ill never be lonely;For you are the stars to me;You are the light I follow;;[Chorus];Ill see you again,, oh;This is not where it ends;I will carry you with me,, oh;'Til I see you again;;[Verse 2];I can hear those echoes in the wind at night;Calling me back in time;Back to you;In a place far away;Where the water meets the sky;The thought of it makes me smile;You are my tomorrow;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking;But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know;Ill see you again,, oh;This is not where it ends;I will carry you with me,, yeah yeah;;[Chorus];;[Outro];'Til I see you again;'Til I see you again;Said goodbye turned around;And you were gone,, gone,, gone
