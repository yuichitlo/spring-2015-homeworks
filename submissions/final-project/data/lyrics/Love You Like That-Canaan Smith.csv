;Hey girl,, Im just a small town run around;I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town;I could never do it like a pretty city boy;Im more a fishin in the dark nitty gritty boy;So lay back and let me paint you a picture;The way I wanna kiss you is;;[Chorus:];Slow as the Mississippi;Strong as a fifth of whiskey;Steady as a Tom Petty track;I wanna love,, wanna love you like that;Deeper than a sunset sky;Sweeter than muscadine wine;All night til the sun comes back;I wanna love,, wanna love,, wanna love you like that;;When Im with you I can see down the road girl;Not just the gravel one were travelin on girl;And Im bettin that its gonna be a wild ride;But I promise that Im gonna be there by your side;I think we got another memory in the makin;So baby lets take it,, take it;;[Chorus];;I aint gonna do it like a pretty city boy;Im a fishin in the dark nitty gritty boy;So let me love you;;[Chorus];;Baby,, I wanna love,, wanna love,, wanna love you like that
