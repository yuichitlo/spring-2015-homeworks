;[Verse 1];If your dream house;Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler;On a country road;Then baby,, that's where we'll go;If you don't wanna settle down;We can bounce around from town to town;And that's fine with me;If you wanna just ride the breeze;;[Hook];I'll go anywhere;West Virginia,, baby I don't care;Mexico on a wild hair;Have you ever seen California;Pick a spot on any old map;I travel light and my bags are packed;Just as long as I'm where you're at;I'm gonna have a real good view;I'll go anywhere,, anywhere with you;;[Verse 2];I'll bet there's a two lane;Running right through the middle;Of a wide open desert to a ghost town;If you wanna just hide out;We could send a postcard back;From a mountain top out in Idaho;Maybe get snowed in;Anytime baby you say when;;[Hook];;[Outro];Girl I'll swear;Just say the word;I'll take you there;Aww anywhere,, anywhere with you;Yeah I'll go anywhere with you
