;[Chorus: Jeremih];Baby don't tell nobody;Yeah I know what your saying is the truth;Baby don't tell nobody;Don't front me off in front of company;You know we could work that out;Maybe we should work that;Maybe we should work that out;You know we could work that;Baby don't tell nobody;Don't front me off in front of company;;[Verse 1: Tink];I just text yo phone like 30 something times in a row;You ain't gotta lie;Cause its going on 5;And if you ain't in my bed;Then you laying with a ho;So fuck that love shit;I don't feel none of that;Like i'm numb to the pain;Said i'm done with the game;But I'm still here running back;Cause I already know your lingo;You talk to these hoes like you're single;You know you really love pulling fast ones;Cheat,, come home and act dumb;Pussy nigga,, pussy nigga;Listen nigga,, I see shit;Even when you ain't in sight;I just hold it in like its pitching time;I've been holding back for a long while;Just hoping soon it'll turn around but;How can I word this;You ain't been perfect;Tell me you working it;Your phone losing service;And now i'm here thinking;Like this nigga tweakin;You sorry,, pathetic and far from authentic;You liar,, you fronter;You just like these other niggas;As much as I hate you;I still wanna date you;You better just hope I don't;;[Chorus];;[Verse 2: Tink];I'm sick of this keep it on the DL shit;You say you with the bros when you out with a bitch;You say you at the crib when you leaving her place;I pull up to ya crib and you lie to my face;He like baby you my all and all,, I was in the bathroom when I missed ya call;Nah you was in the backseat sweating like a athlete doing everything that you said you wouldn't;But I ain't gone trip on a weak ass nigga;I'ma just find me a nigga much bigger;I'ma just do the same shit that you do when i'm not up in the room;Yeah baby lets think;I'mma text Bryan,, Facetime Ryan;Call up Keenan,, tell 'em I need him;Niggas ain't loyal,, and I knew from the jump when you showed me the ropes that I wouldn't never have trust for you;You creepin,, I'm leavin,, you call me,, I pick up,, I hang up;You text me,, lets link up;Then I just say fuck it then we end up fucking;And you start up something I said I was done with;Then It all repeats in the next 2 weeks i'll be back on the same i'm done shit;If they only knew that id rather be loose;Man i'm tempted but i ain't gonna...;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3: Jeremih];Oh Ooohhh;When i'm right there the night gets better;Oh ooohh;You must admit we want together;Cause you don't talk that shit when i give you gas money;5 star chick baby when yo ass hungry;Good weed good dick;Girl you get it all from me;Plenty secrets of you and your world;Even me and you and your girls;That I would never tell nobody;;[Chorus]
