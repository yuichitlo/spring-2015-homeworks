;[Intro];Let it go;Let it go;Cant hold it back anymore;Let it go;Let it go;Turn my back and slam the door;;[Verse 1];The snow glows white on the mountain tonight;Not a footprint to be seen;A kingdom of isolation;And it looks like I'm the queen;The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside;Couldnt keep it in,, heaven knows I tried;;[Pre-Chorus];Dont let them in,, dont let them see;Be the good girl;You always have to be;Conceal,, dont feel;Dont let them know;Well,, now they know;;[Chorus];Let it go;Let it go;Cant hold it back anymore;Let it go;Let it go;Turn my back and slam the door;And here I stand,, and here I'll stay;Let it go;Let it go;The cold never bothered me anyway;;[Verse 2];Its funny how some distance;Makes everything seem small;And the fears that once controlled me;Cant get to me at all;Up here in the cold thin air;I finally can breathe;I know left a life behind;But Im too relieved to grieve;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Standing frozen in the life Ive chosen;You won't find me,, the past is so behind me;Buried in the snow;;[Chorus]
