;[Verse 1]:;I can be tough;I can be strong;But with you;It's not like that at all;;There's a girl;Who gives a shit;Behind this wall;You just walk through it;;[Pre-Chorus]:;And I remember all those crazy thing you said;You left them running through my head;You're always there,, you're everywhere;But right now I wish you were here;All those crazy things we did;Didn't think about it just went with it;You're always there,, you're everywhere;But right now I wish you were here;;[Chorus]:;Damn,, Damn,, Damn;What I'd do to have you here,, here,, here;I wish you were here;Damn,, Damn,, Damn;What I'd do to have you near,, near,, near;I wish you were here;;[Verse 2]:;I love;The way you are;It's who I am;Don't have to try hard;;We always say;Say like it is;And the truth;Is that I really miss;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge] (x2);No,, I don't wanna let go;I just want to let you know;That I never want to let go;Let go,, Oh,, Oh;;[Chorus]
