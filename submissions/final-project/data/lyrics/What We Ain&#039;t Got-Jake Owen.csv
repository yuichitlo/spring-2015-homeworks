;[Verse 1];We all want what we ain't got;Our favorite doors are always locked;On a higher hill with a taller top;We all want what we ain't got;We ain't happy where we are;There's greener grass in the neighbors yard;A bigger house and a faster car;We ain't happy where we are;;[Chorus];All I want is what I had;I'll trade it all just to get her back;She's moving on,, but I guess I'm not;We all want what we ain't got;;[Verse 2];We all wish it didn't hurt;When you try your best and it doesn't work;And goodbye's such a painful word;We all wish it didn't hurt;;[Chorus] [x2];;[Verse 3];I wanted the world until my whole world stopped;You know a love like that ain't easily forgot;I guess we all want what we ain't got;Yeah,, we all want what we ain't got
