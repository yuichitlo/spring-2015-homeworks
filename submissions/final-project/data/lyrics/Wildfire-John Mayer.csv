;[Verse 1];River's strong,, you can't swim inside it;We could string some lights up the hill beside it;Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out;Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about;;[Chorus];You look fine,, fine,, fine;Put your feet up next to mine;We can watch that water line get higher and higher;Say,, say,, say;Hasn't it been some kind of day?;You and me been catching on like a wildfire;;[Verse 2];Don't get up,, just to;Get another,, you can;Drink from mine,, we can't;Leave each other;We can dance with the dead;You can rest your head on my shoulder;If you want to get older with me;Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];I got a rock from the river;In my medicine bag;Magpie feather;In his medicine bag;;[Chorus]
