;I can finally sleep through the night;Roll over to your side;Smell your perfume;And not feel a thing;Hear someone say your name;Picture your pretty face;Not close my eyes;And not feel a sting;;Every time I run into you;Baby I go a little crazy inside;Tell myself I gotta breathe;Try to get my heart to beat;Photographs,, memories;Fade away easily;But youre right here in front of me;Wont let me go;Since you broke my heart;Every time I run into you;I fall apart;Oh,, I fall apart;;Like a shadow right by my side;Theres just no place to hide;This little towns never seemed so small;I should just stay inside;Lock the door and kill the lights;Tum off the phone,, just stare at the wall;;Every time I run into you;Baby I go a little crazy inside;Tell myself I gotta breathe;Try to get my heart to beat;Photographs,, memories;Fade away easily;But youre right here in front of me;Wont let me go;Since you broke my heart;Every time I run into you;I fall apart;;Im looking over my shoulder;When youre not there;Baby I cant go away;;Every time I run into you;Baby I go a little crazy inside;Tell myself I gotta breathe;Try to get my heart to beat;Photographs,, memories;Fade away easily;But youre right here in front of me;Wont let me go;Since you broke my heart;Every time I run into you;I fall apart...
