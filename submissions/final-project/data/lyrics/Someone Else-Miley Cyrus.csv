;[Chorus];If you're looking for love;Know that love don't live here anymore;He left with my heart;They both walked through that door,, without me;If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else;Cause I surely can't help you;I'm hurting myself;I've turned into someone else;;[Verse 1];I used to believe love conquers all;Cause that's what seen in movies;Come to find out it's not like that at all;You see real life's much different;;[Pre-Chorus];I don't want to see you go;I only want to see you smile;It hurts so much just thinking of;Felt like this for awhile;I can't stand to see us there;We cried we lied,, cannot pretend;To change the fact that what we had;To make us feel alive again;;Hold me close;Don't let me go,, I hope;Tell me that now it's not the end;;[Chorus];;[Verse 2];I used to believe love conquers all;Cause that's what I felt when you held me;I thought you'd catch me if I fall;And fill me up when I'm empty;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge x3];Love is patient;Love is selfless;Love is hopeful;Love is kind;Love is jealous;Love is selfish;Love is hopeless;Love is blind;;[Outro];I've turned into someone else
