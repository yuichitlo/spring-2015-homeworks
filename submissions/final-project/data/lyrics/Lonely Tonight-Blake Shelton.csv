;[Verse 1];I never thought youd pick up the phone;It's Friday night,, you should be out on the town;Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me;Nothin' on TV,, nothin' to do;Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me;And the way it was;Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because;I could be there in five;One more one last time;;[Chorus];We don't have to be lonely tonight;(I need you,, want you,, I'm right here);We don't have to be lonely tonight;(I know we shouldn't,, but I don't care);I don't wanna be right,, I don't wanna be strong;I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone;When the sun comes up,, we can both move on;But we don't have to be lonely tonight;;[Verse 2];That taste,, that touch,, the fire I miss;Those kiss me eyes,, your red wine lips on mine;Like it used to be;Baby I want you and and you want me and;;[Chorus];We don't have to be lonely tonight;(I need you,, want you,, I'm right here);We don't have to be lonely tonight;(I know we shouldn't,, but I don't care);I don't wanna be right,, I don't wanna be strong;I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone;When the sun comes up,, we can both move on;But we don't have to be lonely tonight;;[Guitar Interlude];;I can be there in five;One more one last time;;[Final Chorus];We don't have to be lonely tonight;(Oh,, I need you,, and I'm right here);We don't have to be lonely tonight,, tonight,, tonight;;Yeah,, yeah
