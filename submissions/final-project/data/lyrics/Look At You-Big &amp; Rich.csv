;You better hope another man don't look her way too long;You better hope he don't do all the things right that you've done wrong;If he comes knockin' she'll just turn him down;Cause she's not the kind of girl that goes runnin' around;;But you make her wanna cheat on you;For all the hurtin' that you put her through;She wants to stand by her man but I'm not sure if she can;Cause you make her wanna cheat on you;;She tries to be your everything all the time in every way;She lit the candles,, pulled the covers back and put on that lingerie;Then you come walkin' in and you fall into bed;You never say a word or even turn your hea;And it makes her...;;She's been livin' for a love that keeps letting her down';Looking for a reason just to hang around
