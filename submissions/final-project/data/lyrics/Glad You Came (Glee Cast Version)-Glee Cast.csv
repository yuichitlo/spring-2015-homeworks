;[Part I. The Hangover Mass];;I'm sorry,, Mama,, but I've been drinking again;Me and the old man got us a head start on the weekend;And rest assured,, tonight I'm going to be in Kevin's basement with all my friends;Provided we can get,, get our lazy asses down to Bottle King by ten;;And the walk home is going to be a real shit show;I'll be picking up half-smoked cigarette butts all up and down Rock Road;And then to throw up in the warm glow of the traffic light;But I'm gonna put the devil inside to sleep if it takes all night;;So let's get fucked up,, and let's pretend we're all okay;And if you've got something that you can't live with;Save it for another day,, all right?;Save it for another day;;I'm sorry,, Mama,, but expect a call from the neighbors tonight;All of my asshole buddies are coming over and they're feeling a little too all right;I'm sick and tired of everyone in this town being so goddamn uptight;But don't you worry,, I'll do all the talking when they turn on the flashing lights;;When I'm an old man,, I can be the quiet type;And I can go without a moment of fun for the rest of my life;I can read a good book,, and I can be in bed by ten;And I can get up early,, go to work and come home,, and start it all over again;;But while we're young,, boys,, everybody raise your glasses high;Singing,, 'Here's to the good times,, here's to the home team;Kiss the good times goodbye,, oh yeah;Kiss the good times goodbye.';;[Part II. Grandpa's Old Cough Medicine];;I need a timeout,, I need an escape from reality;Or else I need eternal darkness and death,, I need an exit strategy;Down in North Carolina,, I could have been a productive member of society;But these New Jersey cigarettes and all they require have made a fucking junkie out of me;;So give me a Guinness,, give me a Keystone Light;Give me a kegger on a Friday night;Give me anything but another year in exile;;I need a whiskey,, I need a whiskey right now;God knows how many times I've said this before;But I really don't feel like doing this anymore;;[Part III. Song for Tretiak's Movie];;So hey,, Andy,, let's turn into dirty old men;Close down the bar every night at the Glen Rock Inn;Talk about our grandkids as we stroke our grey bears;Funny we're still doing carbombs after all of these years;;And I know there are bicycles waiting to ride;But I could swear I heard voices from the other side,, saying;'Wait until you see the whites of their eyes.';;And now that I'm older,, I look back and say;'What the fuck was it for anyway?';For those dreams are lying in the still of the grave -;What the fuck were they for anyway?;So let it be on a stretcher if I get carried away -;What the fuck was it for anyway?
