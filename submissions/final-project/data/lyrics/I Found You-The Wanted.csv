;[Verse 1: Nathan];She wants me to come over;I can tell her eyes don't lie;She's calling me in the dark;She moves,, I swear the room;Around her lights up like the sky;Confidence like a rockstar;;[Verse 2: Max];I wanna put my hands on her hands;Feel the heat from her skin;Get reckless in the star light;I'm moving to the beat of her heart;I was so lost until tonight;Tonight;;[Chorus];I found you in the darkest hour;I found you in the pouring rain;I found you when I was on my knees;And your light brought me back again;Found you in a river of pure emotion;I found you,, my only truth;I found you and the music played;;[Break];I was lost;Till I found you,, you,, you;Till I found you,, you,, you;;[Verse 3: Tom];The night is getting older;And I can't come off this high;I don't want this here to end;[Siva];I know she feels the same;Cause I can see it in her eyes;She says Can we start again?;;[Verse 4: Max];I wanna put my hands on her hands;Feel the heat from her skin;Get reckless in the star light;[Nathan];She's moving to the beat of my heart;We were so lost until tonight;Tonight;;[Chorus];;[Verse 5: Nathan];I said people;We're all looking for love tonight;But sometimes we can't see it;We're all blinded by the light;And we all get low,, all get low;Searching for that peace of mind;Just when I'd given up;Looking for some kind of sign;;[Bridge];That's when I found you,, you,, you;I found you,, you,, you;I found you,, you,, you;I found you,, you,, you;;[Chorus]
