;[Verse 1];When I set my eyes on you;Gonna keep you out of town at night;When I set my eyes on you;Not gonna be outta my sight;;[Chorus];And now you know;Everywhere on earth you go;You're gonna have me as your man;;[Verse 2];When I get my hands on you;Gonna make you carry me;When I get my hands on you;Gonna make you marry me;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];When I come home to you;Gonna take you down to the riverside;When I come home to you;Hold you in my arms all night;;[Chorus]
