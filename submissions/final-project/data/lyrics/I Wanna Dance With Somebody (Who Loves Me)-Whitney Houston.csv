;[Verse 1];Clocks strikes upon the hour;And the sun begins to fade;Still enough time to figure out;How to chase my blues away;I've done alright up 'til now;It's the light of day that shows me how;And when the night falls;Loneliness calls;;[Chorus][x2];Oh! I want to dance with somebody;I want to feel the heat with somebody;Yeah! I want to dance with somebody;With somebody who loves me;;[Verse 2];I've been in love and lost my senses;Spinning through the town;Soon or later the fever ends;And I wind up feeling down;I need a man who'll take a chance;On a love that burns hot enough to last;So when the night falls;My lonely heart calls;;[Chorus][x2];;[Bridge];Somebody who,, somebody who;I need a man who'll take a chance;On a love that burns hot enough to last;So when the night falls;My lonely heart calls;;[Chorus][x2];;[Outro];Dance;C'mon baby;Dance;Get with this boy;Dance;Don't you want to dance;With me baby;Don't you want to dance;With me boy;Hey don't you want to dance;With me baby;With somebody who loves me;Don't you want to dance say you want to dance;Don't you want to dance;Don't you want to dance say you want to dance;Don't you want to dance;Don't you want to dance say you want to dance;With somebody who loves me
