;[Verse 1];Can't be sleeping,, keep on waking;Without the woman next to me;Guilt is burning,, inside I'm hurting;This ain't a feeling I can keep;;[Chorus] (x2);So blame it on the night;Don't blame it on me,, don't blame it on me;Blame it on the night;Don't blame it on me,, don't blame it on me;;[Drop];Don't blame it on me!;;[Verse 2];Can't you see it? I was manipulated;I had to let her through the door;I had no choice in this,, I was the friend she missed;She needed me to talk;;[Chorus] (x2) + [Drop];;[Bridge];Oh I'm so sorry,, so sorry baby;(I'll be better this time);I will be better this time;I got to say;I'm so sorry;Oh I promise;(I'll be better this time,, I'll be better this time);;[Outro];Don't blame it on me;Don't blame it on me
