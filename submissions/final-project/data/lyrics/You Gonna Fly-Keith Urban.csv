;[Verse 1];One,, two,, three baby don't think twice;Just like that you got a brand new life;Hop in this truck and run through the red lights;Yeah where you want to go baby name the town;We can go up north,, we could head down south;Roll down the windows with the radio loud;;Come on turn it up,, yeah;Start living your life;On the double leave your troubles behind;You and me,, we're going to be alright;;[Chorus];You could be a blackbird;On the country street;Hiding from the world with a broken wing;But you better believe you're going to fly with me;You could be a songbird from New Orleans;Scared of the rain just as scared to sing;But you better believe you're going to fly with me;;[Verse];Well,, here we are baby in the back of my bed;Suns going down skies turning red;Stars coming out;Baby look at you now;God knows how long but it's been a while;Since I heard you laugh and I seen that smile;Felt that kiss and I can get used to this;Baby I could get used to this;;[Chorus];;[Outro];You are going to fly
