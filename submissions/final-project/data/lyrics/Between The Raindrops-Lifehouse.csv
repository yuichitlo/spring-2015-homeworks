;[Verse 1];Look around;There's no one but you and me;Right here and now;The way it was meant to be;There's a smile on my face;Knowing that together everything that's in our way;We're better than alright;;[Hook];Walking between the raindrops;Riding the aftershock beside you;Off into the sunset;Living like there's nothing left to lose;Chasing after gold mines;Crossing the fine lines we knew;Hold on and take a breath;I'll be here every step;Walking between the raindrops with you;;[Verse 2];Take me now;The world's such a crazy place;When the walls come down;You'll know I'm here to stay;There's nothing I would change;Knowing that together everything that's in our way;We're better than alright;;[Hook];;[Bridge];There's a smile on my face;Knowing that together everything that's in our way;We're better than alright;;[Hook]
