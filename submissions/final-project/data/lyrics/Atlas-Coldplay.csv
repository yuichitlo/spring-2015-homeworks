;[Verse 1];Some saw the sun;Some saw the smoke;Some heard the gun;Some bent the bow;Sometimes the wire must tense for the note;Caught in the fire,, say oh;We're about to explode;;[Hook];Carry your world;Ill carry your world;Carry your world;Ill carry your world;;[Verse 2];Some far away;Some search for gold;Some dragon to slay;Heaven we hope is just up the road;Show me the way,, Lord;Cause I,, I'm about to explode;;[Hook];;[Outro];Carry your world,, and all your hurt;(Carry your world)
