;[Verse 1];July moonlight shines;Your pretty little head on my shoulder;Pull over on the side of the road;Oh my God,, you're something;Like nothing I've ever seen;If I'm asleep girl,, let me dream;;[Chorus];Baby fall into my kiss;It should just happen like this;Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and;This moment that says it's so right;Cause that's all we have in this life;Drink up this love,, baby,, give it all we got tonight;;[Verse 2];Summer honeysuckle;Leaking through a rolled down window;We both know when that seat lays back;Anything can happen;So imagine it'll never end;Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be;;[Chorus]
