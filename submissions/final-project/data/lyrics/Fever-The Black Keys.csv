;[Verse 1];Fever,, where'd you run to?;Fever,, where'd you run to?;Acting right is so routine;Fever let me live a dream;Fever I'm a slave to;No one misbehave too;Fever that misunderstood;Wouldn't leave you if I could;Fever;;[Chorus];Fever cause I'm breaking;Fever got me aching;Fever,, why don't you explain?;Break it down again;Fever got me guilty;Just go ahead and kill me;Fever,, why don't you explain?;Break it down again;;[Verse 2];Fever,, can you hear me?;Fever,, can you hear me?;You shook me like I never been;Now show me how to live again;It used to be a blessing;But fever's got me stressing;Realize I am to blame;But fever let me play the game;Fever;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Now if the cold,, pale,, light in your eyes;Reaches those horizon lines;You know not to leave her;Now if the cold,, pale,, light in your eyes;Reaches those horizon lines;You know not to leave her;Fever
