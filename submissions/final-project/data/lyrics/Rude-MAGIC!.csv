;[Verse 1];Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit;Got in my car and raced like a jet,, all the way to you;Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question;Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man,, yeah,, yeah;;[Bridge 1];Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?;Say yes,, say yes;Cause I need to know;You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die;Tough luck,, my friend,, but the answer is no!;;[Chorus];Why you gotta be so rude?;Don't you know I'm human too?;Why you gotta be so rude?;I'm gonna marry her anyway;Marry that girl;Marry her anyway;Marry that girl;Yeah,, no matter what you say;Marry that girl;And we'll be a family;Why you gotta be so rude;;[Verse 2];I hate to do this,, you leave no choice;I can't live without her;Love me or hate me we will be both;Standing at that altar;Or we will run away;To another galaxy you know;You know she's in love with me;She will go anywhere I go;;[Bridge 2];Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?;Say yes,, say yes,, cause I need to know;You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die;Tough luck,, my friend,, cause the answer's still no!;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?;Say yes,, say yes,, cause I need to know;You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die;Tough luck,, my friend,, but no still means no!;;[Chorus]
