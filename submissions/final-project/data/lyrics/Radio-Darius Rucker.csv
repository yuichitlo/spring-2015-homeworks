;[Verse 1];Seventeen,, the only way I had a car;Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go;Four bald tires,, with the ceiling famine and the window stuck;But the only thing I cared about was the radio;We'd turn it on,, turn it up to ten,, and everybody would jump on in;;[Chorus];Riding down the highway;Who wants to be the DJ;I'll find a spot on the side of the road;You find something on the radio;Like a feel real good song;We'll know it when it comes on;Didn't have no money,, no place to go;All we needed was a radio;;[Verse 2];I'd grab my url,, we'd look for somewhere to watch the stars;The perfect place to put it in park and take it slow;She'd sing along,, to even the ones that she barely knew;She still sounded good a little out of tune,, but we didn't care;I'd look at her,, she' d look at me,, I'll never forget that melody;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Shhh,, hey y'all be quit;That's my favorite song;Hey man turn it up loud;Come on,, come on,, come on;;Riding down the highway;Who wants to be the DJ;I'll find a spot on the side of the road;You find something on the radio;Like a feel real good song;We'll know it when it comes on;Didn't have no money,, no place to go;All we needed was a radio;;[Outro];All we needed,, all we needed now;Was a,, was a,, was a radio
