;[Intro];Youve got the bullets;Ive got the gun;Ive got a hankering for getting into something;;I hit the bottle,, you hit the gas;I heard your 65 can really haul some ass;;[Verse 1];Im feeling frisky,, you're feeling good;I guess the whiskey is doing what it should;I got the cigarettes;Youve got a lighter;And when the sun goes down well start a little fire;;[Chorus];Aint no use in trying to slow me down;Cause youre running with the fastest girl in town;;Aint you baby?;I like em crazy;;[Verse 2];My reputation follows me around;Just makes me want to give them more to talk about;Lets go to town for a little while;Ill be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile;;[Chorus];;[Break];Come on!;;[Verse 3];I see the blue lights,, we better run;Throw out the bottle and Ill hide the gun;If he pulls us over Ill turn on the charm;Youll be in the slammer and Ill be on his arm;;[Chorus];Aint no use in trying to slow me down;Cause youre running with the fastest girl in town;;Aint you baby?;Well I told you I was crazy;No I aint no bodys baby;Hey!;;[Outro];Hes got the bullets;Hes got a gun;I got the hankering for getting into something
