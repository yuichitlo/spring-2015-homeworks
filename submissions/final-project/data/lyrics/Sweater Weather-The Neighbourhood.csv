;[Verse 1];All I am is a man;I want the world in my hands;I hate the beach;But I stand in California;With my toes in the sand;Use the sleeves on my sweater;Let's have an adventure;Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered;Touch my neck and I'll touch yours;You in those little high waisted shorts;;[Pre-Chorus];Oh;She knows what I think about;And what I think about;One love,, two mouths;One love,, one house;No shirt,, no blouse;Just us,, you find out;Nothing that I wouldnt wanna tell you about,, no;;[Chorus];Cause it's too cold (whoa);For you here;And now;So let me hold (whoa);Both your hands in the holes of my sweater;;[Verse 2];And if I may just take your breath away;I don't mind if there's not much to say;Sometimes the silence guides your mind;To move to a place so far away;The goosebumps start to race;The minute that my left hand meets your waist;And then I watched your face;Put my finger on your tongue;Cause you love to taste yeah;These hearts adore;Everyone the other beats hardest for;;[Pre-Chorus];Inside this place is warm;Outside it starts to pour;Coming down;One love,, two mouths;One love,, one house;No shirt,, no blouse;Just us,, you find out;Nothing that I wouldnt wanna tell you about,, no;No no;;[Chorus][x2];;Whoa,, whoa;Whoa,, whoa;Whoa,, whoa;;[Chorus][x2];;[Outro];It's too cold,, it's too cold;The hands of my sweater
