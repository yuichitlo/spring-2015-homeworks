;[Verse 1];Loving you was easy;Thought you'd never leave me;Yeah yeah;Wrapped around my finger;See ya when I see ya;Yeah yeah;Now I'm hearing around;That you been running around;I didn't think I'd miss you;Now I'm feeling like a fool;Ooh ohh;;[Chorus];It hit me like a heart attack;When you finally left me girl;I thought I'd never want you back;But I don't wanna live in a world with without you;I don't wanna live in a world with without you;;[Verse 2];Never really noticed;All the little things you did;You did;Never bought you roses;Always was around my friends;My friends;And now I'm hearing around;That you been running around;I didn't think I'd miss you;Now I'm feeling like a fool;Ooh ohh;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Never should have let you slip away;Living in a world that's turned to grey;Little did I know it hurt so bad;Cause It hit me like a heart attack...;;[Chorus];;No oh;;[Outro];Now I'm hearing around;That you been running around;I didn't think I'd miss you;Now I'm feeling like a fool;Ooh ohh!!
