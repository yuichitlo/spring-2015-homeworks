;[Verse 1];The wheels are turning in my mind;Don't wanna leave but I might this time;Seconds from whispering goodbye;Yeah the wheels are turning in my mind;;[Chorus];If all that's left to do is walk away;Then baby I'm as gone as yesterday;But if there's something you still need to say;You need to say it now,, hurry up and slow me down;Slow me down;;[Verse 2];If you let this train roll down these tracks;Gonna wish you tried to talk me back;Boy,, you're gonna miss everything we had;If you let this train roll down these tracks;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];The wheels are turning in my mind;Don't wanna leave but I might this time;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Slow me down;Slow me down
