;[Verse 1: Jess Glynne];We're a thousand miles from comfort;We have travelled land and sea;But as long as you are with me;There's no place I'd rather be;I would wait forever;Exulted in the scene;As long as I am with you;My heart continues to beat;;[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne];With every step we take,, Kyoto to The Bay;Strolling so casually;We're different and the same,, gave you another name;Switch up the batteries;;[Chorus: Jess Glynne];If you gave me a chance I would take it;It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it;Know with all of your heart,, you can't shake me;When I am with you,, there's no place I'd rather be;N-n-n-no,, no,, no,, no place I rather be (3x);;[Verse 2: Jess Glynne];We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace;Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete;It's easy being with you,, sacred simplicity;As long as we're together,, there's no place I'd rather be;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge];Hmmmmmmmmmm,, Hoooooooooo;Be (9x);Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah,, yeah,, yeah;;[Chorus]
