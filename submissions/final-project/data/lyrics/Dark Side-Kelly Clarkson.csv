;[Intro];Oh-oh,, no-oh-oh;;[Verse 1];There's a place that I know;It's not pretty there and few have ever gone;If I show it to you now;Will it make you run away?;;[Verse 2];Or will you stay? Even if it hurts;Even if I try to push you out,, will you return?;And remind me who I really am;Please remind me who I really am;;[Chorus];Everybody's got a dark side;Do you love me? Can you love mine?;Nobody's a picture perfect;But we're worth it;You know that we're worth it;Will you love me?;Even with my dark side?;;[Verse 3];Like a diamond from black dust;It's hard to know what can become if you give up;So don't give up on me;Please remind me who I really am;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Don't run away,, don't run away;Just tell me that you will stay;Promise me you will stay;Don't run away,, don't run away;Just promise me you will stay;Promise me you will stay;Will you love me? Ohh...;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Don't run away,, don't run away;Don't run away,, promise you'll stay
