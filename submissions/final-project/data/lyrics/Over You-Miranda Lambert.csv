;[Intro];Weather man said,, its gonna snow;By now I should,, be used to the cold;;[Verse 1];Mid-February shouldnt be so scary;It was only December;I still remember the presents,, the tree,, you and me;;[Chorus];But you went away;How dare you?;I miss you;They say Ill be OK;But Im not going to ever get over you;;[Bridge];Living alone,, here in this place;I think of you,, and Im not afraid;;[Verse 2];Your favorite records make me feel better;Cause you sing along;With every song;I know you didnt mean to give them to me;;[Chorus];;[Break];It really sinks in,, you know,, when I see it in stone;;[Chorus];Cause you went away;How dare you?;I miss you;They say Ill be OK;But Im not going to ever get over you
