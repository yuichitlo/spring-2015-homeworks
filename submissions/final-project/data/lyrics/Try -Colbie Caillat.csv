;[Verse 1];Put your make up on;Get your nails done;Curl your hair;Run the extra mile;Keep it slim so they like you,, do they like you?;Get your sexy on;Don't be shy,, girl;Take it off;This is what you want,, to belong,, so they like you;Do you like you?;;[Chorus];You don't have to try so hard;You don't have to give it all away;You just have to get up,, get up,, get up,, get up;You don't have to change a single thing;You don't have to try,, try,, try,, try (x4);;[Verse 2];Get your shopping on,, at the mall,, extra credit card;You don't have to choose,, buy it all,, so they like you;Do they like you?;Wait a second;Why should you care,, what they think of you;When you're all alone,, by yourself,, do you like you?;Do you like you?;;[Chorus] (x3);;[Outro];Take your make up off;Put your head down;Take a breath;Look into the mirror,, at yourself;Don't you like you?;Cause I like you
