;[Verse 1];When the days are cold and the cards all fold;And the saints we see are all made of gold;When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail;Are the worst of all and the bloods run stale;;[Pre-Chorus 1];I want to hide the truth,, I want to shelter you;But with the beast inside,, theres nowhere we can hide;No matter what we breed,, we still are made of greed;This is my kingdom come,, this is my kingdom come;;[Chorus];When you feel my heat,, look into my eyes;Its where my demons hide,, its where my demons hide;Dont get too close,, its dark inside;Its where my demons hide,, its where my demons hide;;[Verse 2];At the curtains call is the last of all;When the lights fade out,, all the sinners crawl;So they dug your grave and the masquerade;Will come calling out at the mess you made;;[Pre-Chorus 2];Dont want to let you down,, but I am hell bound;Though this is all for you dont want to hide the truth;No matter what we breed,, we still are made of greed;This is my kingdom come,, this is my kingdom come;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];They say it's what you make,, I say it's up to fate;It's woven in my soul,, I need to let you go;Your eyes,, they shine so bright,, I want to save their light;I can't escape this now,, unless you show me how;;[Chorus]
