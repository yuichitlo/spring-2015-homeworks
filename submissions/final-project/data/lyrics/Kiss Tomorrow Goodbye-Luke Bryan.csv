;[Chorus];All we do right is make love;We both know now that aint enough;Aint gonna beg you to stay;Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong;Aint no reason running after something already gone;Take off your leavin' dress;Lets do what we do best;I guess everybodys got their way of moving on;Girl rest your head one more time in my bed;Love me like you loved me when you loved me;And you didnt have to try;Lets lay down tonight;And kiss tomorrow goodbye;;[Verse];Baby who we are just didnt work;But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt;Aint gonna beg you to stay;Aint gotta ask you whats wrong;Aint no reason running after something already gone;Take off your leavin' dress;Lets do what we do best;I guess everybodys got their way of moving on;Girl rest your head one more time in my bed;Love me like you loved me when you loved me;And you didnt have to try;Lets lay down tonight;And kiss tomorrow goodbye;;[Chorus];Aint gonna beg you to stay;Aint gotta ask you whats wrong;Aint no reason running after something already gone;Take off your leavin' dress;Lets do what we do best;I guess everybodys got their way of moving on;Girl rest your head one more time in my bed;Love me like you loved me when you loved me;And you didnt have to try;Lets lay down tonight;And kiss tomorrow goodbye;Lets kiss tomorrow goodbye
