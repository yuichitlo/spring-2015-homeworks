;[Verse 1];Heart in my mouth;But my head in the clouds,; yeah;I can feel it rising;Bound to the earth;But we could ascend yeah,; I'm realising;;[Hook];I feel both feet lift off the ground;I can levitate;With every chord that plays;I close my eyes and levitate;;[Verse 2];The air is electric;It heightens the senses;I can feel it changing;I'll never forget it;We're transcending;And I know it's starting;;[Hook];;[Verse 1];;[Hook]
