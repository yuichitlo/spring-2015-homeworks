;[Verse 1];The trouble with girls is theyre a mystery;Something about em puzzles me;Spent my whole life trying to figure out;Just what them girls are all about;The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty;Everything about em does something to me;But I guess thats the way its supposed to be;;[Chorus];They smile,, that smile;They bat those eyes;They steal you with hello;They kill you with goodbye;They hook you with one touch and you cant break free;Yeah,, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me;;[Verse 2];Theyre sugar and spice and angel wings;And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans;A summer night,, down by the lake;An old memory that you cant shake;Theyre hard to find,, yet theres so many of em;The way that you hate,, that you already love em;But I guess thats the way its supposed to be;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];The way they hold you out on the dance floor;The way they ride in the middle of your truck;The way they give you a kiss at the front door;Leave you wishing you could have gone up;And just as you walk away;You hear that sweet voice say...;Stay;;[Chorus]
