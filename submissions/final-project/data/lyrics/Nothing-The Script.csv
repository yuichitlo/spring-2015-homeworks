;[Interlude];Am I better off dead?;Am I better off a quitter?;They say I'm better off now;Than I ever was with her;;[Verse 1];As they take me to my local down the street;I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet;They say a few drinks will help me to forget her;But after one too many I know that I'm never;Only they can't see where this is gonna end;They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense;;[Pre-Hook];And my mates are all there trying to calm me down;Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town;I'm swearing if I go there now;I can change her mind turn it all around;;[Hook];And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words;And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred;Dialed her number and confessed to her;I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing;;[Verse 2];So I stumble there,, along the railings and the fences;I know if I faced her face,, that she'll come to her senses;Every drunk step I take leads me to her door;If she sees how much I'm hurting,, she'll take me back for sure;;[Pre-Hook];;[Hook];;She said nothing;Oh,, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing;Oh,, I got nothing;Oh,, I got nothing;Oh,, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing;;Ohh,, sometimes love's intoxicating;Ohh,, you're coming down,, your hands are shaking;When you realize there's no one waiting;;[Interlude];Am I better off dead?;Am I better off a quitter?;They say I'm better off now;Than I ever was with her;;[Pre-Hook];;[Hook];;[Outro];She said nothing;Oh,, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing;Oh,, I got nothing;I got nothing;I wanted words but all I heard was nothing;Ohh I got nothing;;I got nothing [x3]
