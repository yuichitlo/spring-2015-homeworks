;[Verse 1];I love it when you just don't care;I love it when you dance like there's nobody there;So when it gets hard,, don't be afraid;We don't care what them people say;I love it when you don't take no;I love it when you do what you want cause you just said so;Let them all go home,, we out late;We don't care what them people say;;[Chorus];We dont have to be ordinary;Make your best mistakes;Cause we dont have the time to be sorry;So baby be the life of the party;Im telling you to take your shot it might be scary;Hearts are gonna break;Cause we dont have the time to be sorry;So baby be the life of the party;;[Verse 2];Together we can just let go;Pretend like theres no one else here that we know;Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays;We dont care what them people say;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Come out tonight,, come out tonight;Theres no one standing in your way;Come out tonight,, come out tonight;We dont care what them people say;We dont care what them people say;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Yeah,, yeah,, yeah;Life of the party;So dont let them keep you down;Oh you know you cant give up;Cause we dont have the time to be sorry;So baby be the life of the party
