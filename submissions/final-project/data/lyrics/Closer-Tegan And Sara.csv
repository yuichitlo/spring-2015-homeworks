;[Verse 1];All I want to get is a little bit closer;All I want to know is;Can you come a little closer;Here comes the breath before we get a little bit closer;Here comes the rush before we touch;Come a little closer;The doors are open,, the wind is really blowing;The night sky is changing overhead;;[Chorus];Its not just all physical;Im the type who will get oh so critical;So lets make things physical;I wont treat you like youre oh so typical;;[Verse 2];All you think of lately is getting underneath me;All Im dreaming lately is how to get you underneath me;Here comes the heat before we meet a little bit closer;Here comes the spark before the dark;Come a little closer;The lights are off and the sun is finally setting;The night sky is changing overhead;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I want you close;I want you;I wont treat you like youre typical;Here come the dreams of you and me;Here come the dreams;Here come the dreams of you and me;Here come the dreams;;[Chorus];;[Outro];I want you close;I want you;I wont treat you like youre typical;I want you close;I want you;I wont treat you like youre typical;All I want to get is a little bit closer;All I want to know is;Can you come a little closer
