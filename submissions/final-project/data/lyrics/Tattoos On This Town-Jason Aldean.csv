;[Verse 1];There's still black marks on that county road;Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs;And weathered all the sun and rain;And to this day up on that overpass;Even underneath the new paint,, you can still see;Allie,, will you marry me?;;[Interlude];Take a ride,, look around;There ain't no doubt;;[Chorus];It sure left its mark on us,, we sure left our mark on it;We let the world know we were here with everything we did;We laid a lot of memories down,, like tattoos on this town;;[Verse 2];There's still a rope burn on that old branch,, that hangs over the river;I still got the scar;From swinging out a little too far;There ain't a corner of this hallow ground;That we don't laughed or cried on;It's where we loved,, lived and learned real life stuff;It's everything we're made of;;[Chorus];It sure left its mark on us,, we sure left our mark on it;We let the world know we were here with everything we did;We laid a lot of memories down,, like tattoos on this town;Like tattoos on this town;;[Bridge];Everywhere,, there we are;It hits me right in my heart;;[Verse 3];It sure left its mark on us,, we sure left our mark on it;We let the world know we were here with everything we did;We laid a lot of memories down;And we'll always be hanging around;Like tattoos on this town;Like tattoos on this town
