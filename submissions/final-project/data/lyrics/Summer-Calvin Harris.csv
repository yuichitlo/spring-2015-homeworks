;[Verse];When I met you in the summer;To my heartbeat's sound;We fell in love;As the leaves turned brown;And we could be together baby;As long as skies are blue;You act so innocent now;But you lied so soon;When I met you in the summer;;[Instrumental Break + Verse + Instrumental Break];;[Bridge];When I met you in the summer;Summer;;[Instrumental Break]
