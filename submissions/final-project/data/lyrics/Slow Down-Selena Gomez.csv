;[Verse 1];Now that I have captured your attention;I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention;Mr. TSA I'm ready for inspection;Show me how you make a first impression;;[Pre-Chorus];Oh,, oh;Can we take it nice and slow,, slow;Break it down and drop it low,, low;Because I just want to party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go;;[Chorus];I just want to feel your body right next to mine;All night long,, baby,, slow down the song;And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind;All night long,, baby,, slow down the song;Yeah,, baby,, slow down the song;Yeah,, baby,, slow down the song;;[Verse 2];If you want me,, I'm accepting applications;So long as we keep this record on rotation;You know I'm good with mouth to mouth resuscitation;Breathe me in,, breathe me out;So amazing;;[Pre-Chorus &amp,; Chorus];;[Bridge x2];Breathe me in,, breathe me out,, the music's got me going;Breathe me in,, breathe me out,, no stop until the morning;Breathe me in,, breathe me out,, you know I'm ready for it;For it,, for it,, yeah;;(It's the cataracs);;[Chorus];;[Outro];How do I do it;It's The Cataracs;Ha ha ha
