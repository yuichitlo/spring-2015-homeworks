;[Verse 1];Right there's the high school;Where we met;We'd sneak out back;For a couple of kisses and a cigarette;And that parking lot;Was our first date;And her momma slammed the door;When I dropped her off too late;;[Pre-Chorus 1];She's gone;Chasing that highway wind;She's gone;She ain't coming back again;;[Chorus];This ain't nothing;Nothing but a goodbye town;These streets are only bringing me down;Got to find a way to finally get out;Out of this goodbye town;;[Verse 2];We sat down on those;Courthouse steps;Fourth of July;Those fireworks over our heads;And they'd ring the bells;Of that little church;No there ain't nowhere;I can look that doesn't hurt;;[Pre-Chorus 2];She's gone;But I still feel her on my skin;She's gone;But she ain't coming back again;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I can't erase the memories;And I can't burn the whole place down;;[Chorus];No this ain't nothing;Nothing but a goodbye town;To hell if I'm sticking around;Got to find a way to finally get out;Out of this goodbye town (Oh,, yeah);Out of this goodbye town;I'm out of this town;So out of this town;;[Break];Oh oh oh oh oh;;[Outro];You'll be just a memory in the back of my mind;You'll be just a memory,, yeah;Oh,, somewhere in the back of my mind;In the back of my mind,, yeah;One day you're going to look back at what we had;You're going to think of me;You're going to think of me;When I'm long gone;I'll be long gone
