;[Verse 1];I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks;I heard he's got a Prius,, because he's into being green;My buddies said he saw y'all,, eating that sushi stuff;Baby that don't sound like you,, that don't sound like love;Sounds like it sucks;;[Chorus];He can't even bait a hook;He can't even skin a buck;He don't know who Jack Daniels is;He ain't ever drove a truck;Knows how to throw out a line;But not the kind in a field and stream book;No darling I ain't even worried,, you'll come running back;He can't even bait a hook;;[Verse 2];Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?;Has he took you to meet his mama,, back in his home town?;Does he drive the interstate,, or does he take them old back roads?;Can he melt your heart with a country song,, every good old boy should know?;I didn't think so;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];It won't be that long,, until you start getting bored;I'll be smiling on the river,, reeling in one more;;[Chorus];;[Outro];No baby I ain't even worried;He can't even bait a hook
