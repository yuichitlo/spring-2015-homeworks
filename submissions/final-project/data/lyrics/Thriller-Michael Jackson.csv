;[Verse 1];It's close to midnight;Something evil's lurking from the dark;Under the moonlight;You see a sight that almost stops your heart;You try to scream;But terror takes the sound before you make it;You start to freeze;As terror looks you right between your eyes;You're paralyzed;;;[Verse 2];You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run;You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun;You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination;Girl but all the while;You hear a creature creeping up behind;You're outta time;;[Chorus 2];Cause this is thriller,, thriller night;There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes,, girl;Thriller,, thriller night;You're fighting for your life inside of killer,, thriller tonight;;[Bridge];Night creatures call;And the dead start to walk in their masquerade;There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time;They're open wide;This is the end of your life;;[Verse 3];They're out to get you,, there's demons closing in on every side;They will possess you,, unless you change that number on your dial;Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together,, yeah;All through the night;I'll save you from the terror on the screen,, I'll make you see;;[Chorus 3];That this is thriller,, thriller night;Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try;Thriller,, thriller night;So let me hold you tight;And share a killer,, thriller,, chiller;Thriller here tonight;Cause this is thriller,, thriller night;Girl I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try;Thriller,, thriller night;So let me hold you tight;And share a killer,, thriller;I'm gonna thrill you tonight;;[Spoken Word];Darkness falls across the land;The midnight hour is close at hand;Creatures crawl in search of blood;To terrorize y'all's neighborhood;And whosoever shall be found;Without the soul for getting down;Must stand and face the hounds of hell;And rot inside a corpse's shell;;I'm gonna thrill you tonight;(Thriller,, thriller);I'm gonna thrill you tonight;(Thriller night,, thriller);I'm gonna thrill you tonight;Ooh,, babe,, I'm gonna thrill you tonight;Thriller night,, babe;;[Spoken word];The foulest stench is in the air;The funk of forty thousand years;And grizzly ghouls from every tomb;Are closing in to seal your doom;And though you fight to stay alive;Your body starts to shiver;For no mere mortal can resist;The evil of the thriller
