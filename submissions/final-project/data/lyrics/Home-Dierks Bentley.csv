;[Verse 1];West,, on a plane bound west;I see her stretching out below;Land,, blessed mother land;The place where i was born;Scars,, yeah shes got her scars;Sometimes it starts to worry me;Cause lose,, i dont wanna lose;Sight of who we are;;[Pre-Chorus];From the mountains high;To the wave crashed coast;Theres a way to find;Better days i know;;[Chorus];Its been a long hard ride;Got a ways to go;But this is still the place;That we all call home;;[Verse 2];Free,, nothing feels like free;Though it sometimes means we dont get along;Cause same,, no we're not the same;But thats what makes us strong;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Brave,, gotta call it brave;To chase that dream across the sea;Names,, and they signed their names;For something they believed;Red,, how the blood ran red;And we laid our dead in sacred ground;Just think,, wonder what they think;If they could see us now;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Its been a long hard ride;And i wont lose hope;This is still the place;That we all call home
