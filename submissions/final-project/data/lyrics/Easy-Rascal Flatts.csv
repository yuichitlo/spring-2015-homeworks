;[Verse 1];We broke up;Yeah,, it's tough;Most guys would've been crushed;Wasting their time;Wondering where they went wrong;No way,, not me;Hey,, I'm doing just fine;I'm not afraid of moving on;;[Chorus];It's easy going out on a Friday night;Easy every time I see her out;I can smile,, live it up;The way a single guy does;But what she,, what she don't know;Is how hard it is to make it look so;Easy;;[Verse 2];The truth is;That I miss lying in those arms of his;But I don't ever let it show;I laugh and I act like;I'm having the time of my life;As far as he knows;;[Chorus][x2];It's easy going out on a Friday night;Easy,, everytime I see him out;I can smile,, live it up;The way a single girl does;But,, what he,, what he don't know;Is how hard it is to make it look so;Easy;Oh,, it's easy
