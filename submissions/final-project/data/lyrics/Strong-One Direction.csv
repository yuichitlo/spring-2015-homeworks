;[Verse 1];My hands,, your hands;Tied up like two ships drifting;Weightless,, waves try to break it;I'd anything to save it;Why is it so hard to save it?;My heart,, your heart;Sit tight like bookends;Pages between us;Written with no end;So many words we're not saying;Don't wanna wait till it's gone;You make me strong;;[Chorus];I'm sorry if I say,, I need you;But I don't care,, I'm not scared of love;Cause when I'm not with you I'm weaker;Is that so wrong?;Is it so wrong? That you make me strong;;[Verse 2];Think of how much love that's been wasted;People always try to escape it;Move on to stop their heart breaking;But there's nothing I'm running from;You make me strong;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];So baby hold on to my heart;Need you to keep me from falling apart;I'll always hold on;Cause you make me strong;;[Chorus x3]
