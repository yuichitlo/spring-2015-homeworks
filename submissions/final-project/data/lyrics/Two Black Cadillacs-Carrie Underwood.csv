;[Verse 1];Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade;Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day;One is for his wife;The other for the woman who loved him at night;Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time;;[Chorus];And the preacher said he was a good man;And his brother said he was a good friend;But the women in the two black veils didnt bother to cry;Bye bye,, bye bye;Yeah they took turns laying a rose down;Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground;Hes not the only one who had a secret to hide;Bye bye,, bye bye,, bye bye;;[Break];Two black Cadillacs,, two black Cadillacs;;[Verse 2];Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone;Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long;They decided then hed never get away with doing this to them;Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time,, right time;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face;They shared a crimson smile and just walked away;And left the secret at the grave;;[Chorus]
