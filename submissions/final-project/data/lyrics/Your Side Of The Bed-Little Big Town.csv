;[Verse 1:  Karen];On your side of the bed,, there's a picture of our wedding day;A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave;It's on the window side,, where the moon creeps in at night;Staring at the ceiling,, lying here all alone;I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own;But you don't reach for me,, when you lie down quietly;;[Chorus];Tell me how,, how'd you get so far away?;All we have left are the memories of the love we made;Are you sleeping with your own regret?;On your side of the bed;;[Verse 2: Jimi];On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame;A letter I started but I didn't know what to say;No I couldn't write it down,, so I'll try to say it now;;[Chorus];Tell me how,, how'd you get so far away?;All we have left are the memories of the love we made;Are you sleeping with your own regret?;On your side of the bed;;[Verse 3];Aren't you even going to make a sound?;Your side of the bed;Turn the other way when I turn the lights down;Your side of the bed;Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?;;[Chorus x2];How,, how'd you get so far away?;All we have left are the memories of the love we made;Are you sleeping with your own regret?;On your side of the bed;;[Outro];On your side of the bed;Are you still awake,, on your side of the bed
