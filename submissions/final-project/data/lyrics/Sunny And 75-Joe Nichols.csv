;A yellow two piece,, black Ray Bans;Your bare feet covered in sand;White jet trails across the blue sky;Your ponytail showing off the sunshine;Like a postcard,, out of nowhere;You get to me,, you give me that smile and;;[Chorus];I'm somewhere,, somewhere sunny and 75;You and me on a beach chair;Yeah,, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes;Kissing you and the salt air;I can taste it,, I swear;Take me somewhere sunny and 75;;It doesn't take much for you to move me;Just the way you're leaning into me;It's a holiday when we're together;I wanna stay with you forever;;[Chorus];Somewhere,, somewhere sunny and 75;You and me on a beach chair;Yeah,, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes;Kissing you and the salt air;I can taste it,, I swear;Take me somewhere sunny and 75;;You're like the fast lane West bound;You feel like a windows rolled down;I can't wait until we get there,, somewhere;;[Chorus};Somewhere sunny and 75;You and me on a beach chair;Yeah,, I'm so there every time I look in your eyes;Kissing you and the salt air;I can taste it,, I swear;Take me somewhere sunny and 75
