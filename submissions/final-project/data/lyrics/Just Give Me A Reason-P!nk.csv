;[Verse 1: Pink];Right from the start;You were a thief you stole my heart;And I your willing victim;I let you see the parts of me;That weren't all that pretty;And with every touch you fixed them;Now you've been talking in your sleep;Oh Oh;Things you never say to me;Oh Oh;Tell me that you've had enough;Of our love,, our love;;[Chorus: Pink];Just give me a reason;Just a little bit's enough;Just a second we're not broken just bent;And we can learn to love again;It's in the stars;It's been written in the scars on our hearts;We're not broken just bent;And we can learn to love again;;[Verse 2: Nate Ruess (and Pink)];I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from;I thought that we were fine;(Oh we had everything);Your head is running wild again;My dear we still have everything;And it's all in your mind;Yeah but this is happening;You've been having real bad dreams;Oh oh;You used to lie so close to me;Oh oh;There's nothing more than empty sheets;Between our love,, our love,, oh our love,, our love;;[Chorus];;[Bridge: Nate Ruess and Pink];Oh tears ducts and rust;I'll fix it for us;We're collecting dust but our love's enough;You're holding it in;You're pouring a drink;No nothing is as bad as it seems;We'll come clean;;[Chorus: Both x2];;[Outro: Both];Oh we can learn to love again;Oh we can learn to love again;Oh;That we're not broken just bent;And we can learn to love again
