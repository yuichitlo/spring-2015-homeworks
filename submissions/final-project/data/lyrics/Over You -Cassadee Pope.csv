;[Verse 1];Maybe one day,, I'll just let it all go;Let every shade of my true colors show;Keep loving me till' I lost all control eventually;Never wanna be,, never wanna be that girl;With the million needs who keeps running your world;Boy do you lie when you say I look good tonight?;;[Chorus];I see a mess in the mirror,, but you see the girl of your dreams;I see the dark clouds rolling in,, but you see the sky I can't see;I hear this melody coming out all wrong,, but you hear a song;You hear a song;;[Verse 2];They keep talking,, all the ghosts from my past;Heart broken,, can't get over it fast;Just give it up,, stays around and it never leaves;;[Chorus];I see a mess in the mirror,, but you see the girl of your dreams;I see the dark clouds rolling in,, but you see the sky I can't see;I hear this melody coming out all wrong,, but you hear a song;You hear a song;;[Bridge];You hear a song,, a one note symphony;Baby come on,, and sing it back to me;;[Chorus];I see a mess in the mirror,, but you see the girl of your dreams;I see the dark clouds rolling in,, but you see the sky I can't see;I hear this melody coming out all wrong,, but you hear a song;You hear a song
