;[Verse 1];Regrets collect like old friends;Here to relive your darkest moments;I can see no way,, I can see no way;And all of the ghouls come out to play;And every demon wants his pound of flesh;But I like to keep some things to myself;I like to keep my issues drawn;It's always darkest before the dawn;;And I've been a fool and I've been blind;I can never leave the past behind;I can see no way,, I can see no way;I'm always dragging that horse around;Our love has passed,; such a mournful sound;Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground;So I like to keep my issues drawn;But it's always darkest before the dawn;;[Chorus];Shake it out,, shake it out;Shake it out,, shake it out,, ooh whoa;Shake it out,, shake it out;Shake it out,, shake it out,, ooh whoa;And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back;So shake him off,, oh whoa;;[Verse 2];And I am done with my graceless heart;So tonight I'm going to cut it out and then restart;Because I like to keep my issues drawn;It's always darkest before the dawn;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back;And given half the chance,, would I take any of it back;It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone;It's always darkest before the dawn;;[Bridge];And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't;So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope;And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope;It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat;Because looking for heaven,, found the devil in me;Looking for heaven,, found the devil in me;Well,, why the hell did I let it happen to me?!;;[Chorus][x2];;[Outro];(What the hell) [x2]
