;[Verse 1];I'm clumsy;Yeah my head's a mess,, cause you got me;Growing taller everyday;We're giants in a little man's world;My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst;;[Pre-Chorus];I'm trying so hard not to let it show;But you got me feeling like;I'm stepping on buildings,, cars,, and boats;I swear I could touch the sky;;[Chorus];Ohhh,, I'm ten feet tall;Ohhh,, I'm ten feet tall;;[Verse 2];Be careful,, so don't be afraid;Your safe here,, no these arms won't let you break;I put up a sign in the clouds;They all know that we ain't ever coming down;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge];You build me up;Make me what I never was;You build me up;From nothing into something;Yeah something from the dust;;[Pre-Chorus];[Chorus]
