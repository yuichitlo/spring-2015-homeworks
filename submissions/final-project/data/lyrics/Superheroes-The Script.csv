;[Verse 1];All her life,, she has seen;The meaner side of me;They took away the prophet's dream;For a profit on the street;Now she's stronger than you know;A heart of steel starts to grow;;All his life,, he's been told;He'll be nothing when he's old;All the kicks and all the blows;He won't ever let it show;Because he's stronger than you know;A heart of steel starts to grow;;[Chorus];When you've been fighting for it all your life;You've been struggling to make things right;Thats a how a superhero learns to fly;(Every day,, every hour,, turn that pain into power);When you've fighting for it all your life;You've been working every day and night;Thats a how a superhero learns to fly;(Every day,, every hour,, turn that pain into power);;[Verse 2];All the hurt,, all the lies;All the tears that they cry;When the moment is just right;You'll see fire in their eyes;Because they're stronger than you know;A heart of steel starts to grow;;[Chorus];;[Bridge x2];She's got a light in her heart,, a fire in his soul;Got a beast in his belly,, but it's so hard to control;Cause they've taken too much hits,, take it blow by blow;Now light a match,, stand back,, watch them explode;;[Chorus]
