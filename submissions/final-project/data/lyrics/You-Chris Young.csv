;Have you ever been given a set of facts,, and based on that evidence,, come to a conclusion that made you believe you were absolutely right?;;A few years back,, I was contacted by a defense attorney who asked if Id be an expert witness in a case involving an aspiring rapper whod been charged with making a terrorist threat. This would be my first official expert witness case so I jumped at the chance.;;And as a professor of Criminology,, as well as a rap music scholar -- this doesnt look like a rap music scholar? -- I was ready to jump at the chance. so as soon as I received the evidence,, I immediately got to work.;;Now this particular case came to trial as a result of just six short lines of text. The lines were:;glock to the head of;send $2 to a paypal account;if this account doesnt reach $50,,000 in the next 7 days then a murderous rampage similar to the Virginia Tech shooting will occur at another highly populated university.;;This is not a joke.Ok,, admittedly,, seeing these words the a page,, all by their lonesome,, make it pretty darn easy to jump to a conclusion about what this aspiring rapper is up to. Right? And Ive got to admit,, when I read those words for the first time,, even my gut reaction was,, oh please,, this guy is so guilty. But,, I knew from years of research that you cannot pass judgment until all the evidence has been reviewed.;;So,, I began by trying to understand just how these words landed in the hands of the Southern Illinois University Police. One day while on patrol,, they spotted an abandoned car,, searched it,, and found typical college student possessions inside,, along with a piece of paper inconspicuously tucked between the drivers seat and the console.;;Now on one side of that paper were the six lines of threatening text. But if you flip the paper over,, there were line after line of what appeared to be rap lyrics. Lines like,, let them booty cheeks hop. Seriously. I cant make this stuff up. Let them booty cheeks hop,, so pop it mommy pop it. Imma do it like this daddy,, follow that thing to the ground when she drop it.;;Well the minute I saw these rhyming rap lyrics on the other side of the threatening note,, I had a sneaking suspicion that this college student was not a plotting terrorist,, but an aspiring gangster rapper.;;But thats not how the police saw it. These six lines of text were enough evidence to secure a search warrant and comb through the defendant,, [Olutosin Oduwole]s campus apartment. During the search they uncovered his notebooks filled with violent and misogynistic lyrics that he had penned. And a gun.;;This was enough evidence to charge Oduwole,, a college student,, with no prior convictions,, of attempting to communicate a terrorist threat.;;Now Oduwole admitted to the gun possession charges,, but he adamantly denied he was a terrorist planning to carry out acts of violence. He stood by his story that the six lines of text were just notes or ideas for a rap song he was working on.;;In preparation for testifying,, I reviewed hundreds of pages of evidence from Oduwoles notebooks. As I painstakingly analyzed line after line of the evidence,, wading through stanza after stanza of violent and misogynistic lyrics,, I would land upon an occasional random page,, that had notes from a class,, a letter to a girl,, and the terms of the rap contract that Oduwole one day dreamed of landing.;;After careful review of this evidence,, I was pretty certain Oduwole was unequivocally not a terrorist.;;He was just a wannabe rapper whose shocking and offensive lyrics were,, out of a fear of terrorism,, being completely misinterpreted.;;Trial day arrived,, and I was ready to share my findings. That is,, until I walked into the courtroom and stood face to face with an all white,, middle aged jury. This was 2011,, I could barely believe my eyes. But despite the lack of diversity,, I was certain the evidence would prevail. So when I took the witness stand,, I spent the next several hours educating the jury on the finer points of gangster rap.;;For example,, in the rap world,, the more violent your lyrics,, the more respect youll have in the rap community. And the more violent and misogynistic your music,, well,, the more songs youll sell. Considering the business,, it was not surprising to me at all that Oduwoles lyrics portrayed a violent person and the glorification of guns,, both of which are staples of gangster rap.;;And I also explained to the jury,, that not all lyrics rhyme or flow,, and that the six lines of text the prosecution had rested their case upon could be whats referred to in the music business as an intro or an outro. or unrhymed spoken words that either introduce or conclude a song to give it more edge or to make it more meaningful.;;It was my professional opinion that the six lines of text were either notes or ideas for a new rap song or were the intro or outro to the song,, not a terrorist threat.;;Well when I stood off that witness stand and stepped down,, I felt confident that Id shared my findings with the jury,, that I had compellingly delivered my arguments. And in just three short hours,, the verdict.;;Guilty.;;Oduwole was sentenced to five years and whisked off to prison. And I was completely stunned.;;How had the jury been unable to see the truth? For weeks,, I replayed the case over and over in my mind. How were the prosecution's arguments more persuasive than my highly researched evidence?;;And then it dawned on me. While I had presented the cold hard facts,, the prosecuting attorney,, he dialed up the courtroom emotion and played to the jurys fears. At one point,, he even slammed down Oduwoles gun on the witness stand,, leaned in close,, stared me dead in the eye,, and asked,, now does that change your opinion about what's written in the six lines of text?;;It was in that moment I realized how the prosecution swayed the jury. emotions trump logic every time. And the power of emotions lead me to this question: would this case be the same if the defendant was white?;;Student + white male + rap = a wannabe rapper.;;And if you add gun to the equation,, well,, hes lost his way and needs some counselling.;;But if you swap in black male for white,, it adds up to something very different.;;Student + black male + rap = someone whos headed for trouble.;;And if you bring in a gun? Well,, then he is certainly a thug destined for prison.;;Its been three years since I testified in the Oduwole trial,, and since then,, Ive wondered,, is he the only aspiring rapper this has happened to? Knowing the system failed this young man and sent him to prison for terrorism troubled me to the core. And thankfully I was not alone.;;The Oduwole verdict drew widespread scrutiny from First Amendment rights attorneys,, journalists,, musicians,, and academics alike. I started seeing op-eds featuring the case,, several of which were written by an assistant professor at the University of Richmond who researches rap and hip hop culture. Within short order this professor and I got together and discovered that rap lyrics are turning up with alarming regularity as evidence in courtrooms across the country.;;In fact,, our research has uncovered hundreds of these cases.;;And whats so crazy is that its virtually unheard of for musicians outside of rap to have their lyrics introduced against them. Not for rock,, not for punk,, not even for heavy metal. Over the last year my colleague and I have publicized our research findings. And just last month we wrote a brief to educate the Justices about gangster rap,, for a rap lyrics case that will soon be heard by the US Supreme Court. In all our work,, we argue that rather than treat rap as a form of artistic expression,, prosecutors,, like to say that the music is autobiographical,, that rappers are just sharing the stories of their lives.;;The problem with portraying rap as autobiographical is that the characters portrayed in rap are often nothing like the rappers themselves. And in some cases,, like Oduwole,, the lyrics themselves are the crime,, being positioned as an imminent threat to the public. But no matter the prosecutions tactics,, using rap lyrics as evidence almost always results in unfair prejudice. In case after case,, defendants have been found guilty and sent off to prison;;But why?;;In an experimental study,, a social psychologist presented two groups of diverse subjects with two sets of identical violent lyrics. The lyrics were:;Well,, early one evening i was roamin around,,;I was feelin kind of mean,, I shot a deputy down.Now the first group was told that these lyrics came from a rap song. And the second? From a country song. I bet you can guess the findings of this study.;;What was discovered was the first group,, who thought they had rap lyrics,, viewed the words as more threatening and dangerous,, compared to the group who thought they had country.;;Even though the lyrics were exactly identical,, both groups likely had preconceived ideas about each type of music. Country is made by good southern white boys. And rap? Is made by urban black criminals. So what happens in these cases is this: by prosecutors playing to jurors preconceived notions about rap music,, they also tap into race. Which ratchets up public fear and reinforces old and new stereotypes about young men of color as inherently threatening and dangerous;;Which leads me to this: are these increases in rap trials just another example that racism in this country is alive and well? And how many more false convictions and acts of violence against our own people will it take before we say,, enough?;;For me the tipping point will arrive when we admit as a country that we are still playing out old racial stereotypes. Then,, and only then,, will we begin to heal from our collective and historical wounds.;;We have to remember,, and we can never forget,, that our nation and its people are one. Indivisible. With liberty and justice for all.;;Thank you.
