;[Verse 1:];I want you by my side;So that I never feel alone again;Theyve always been so kind;But now theyve brought you away from here;I hope they didn't get your mind;Your heart is too strong anyway;We need to fetch back the time;They have stolen from us;;[Chorus:];And I want you;We can bring it on the floor;Youve never danced like this before;But we dont talk about it;Dancin on doin the boogie all night long;Stoned in paradise;Shouldnt talk about it;Shouldn't talk about it x2;;[Verse 2:];Coldest winter for me;No sun is shining anymore;The only thing I feel is pain;Caused by absence of you;Suspense is controlling my mind;I cannot find the way out of here;I want you by my side;So that I never feel alone again;;[Chorus]
