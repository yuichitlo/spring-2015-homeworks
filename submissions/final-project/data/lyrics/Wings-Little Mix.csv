;[Verse 1];Mamma told me not to waste my life;She said spread your wings my little butterfly;Don't let what they say keep you up at night;And if they give you shhhh..;Then they can walk on by;My feet,, feet can't touch the ground;And I can't hear a sound;But you just keep on running up your mouth yeah;Walk,, walk on over there;Cause I'm too fly to care,, oh yeah;;[Bridge];Your words don't mean a thing;I'm not listening;Keep walking,, all I know is;;[Chorus];Mamma told me not to waste my life;She said spread your wings my little butterfly;Don't let what they say keep you up at night;And they can't detain you;Cause wings are made to fly;And we don't let nobody bring us down;No matter what you say it won't hurt me;Don't matter if I fall from the sky;These wings are made to fly;;[Verse 2];Huh,, huh;I'm firing up on that runway;I know we're gonna get their someday;But we don't need no ready steady go,, no;Talk,, talk turns into air;And I don't even care,, oh yeah;;[Bridge];;[Chorus];;[Interlude];I don't need no one saying hey,, hey,, hey,, hey;I don't hear no one saying hey,, hey,, hey,, hey,, hey,, hey,, hey,, hey;You better keep on walking;I don't wanna hear your talking boy;You better keep on walking;I don't wanna hear your talking boy;;[Bridge];;[Chorus]
