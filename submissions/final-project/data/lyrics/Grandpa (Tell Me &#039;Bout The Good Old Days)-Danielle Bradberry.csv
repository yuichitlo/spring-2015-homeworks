;[Chorus 2x];Its a vendetta,, youre f*cking with someone who pull out the blammer;Its a vendetta,, were putting your body on top of the blender;Its a vendetta (woo-woo) Its a vendetta [2x];;[VERSE];My homey told somebody talking bout us;We run on yo block and we pull out that sh*t that makes people go suss;We dont give a f*ck man were up in the project were feeling finesse;My flow looks like it has been on a vessel;I dont play games but I lay you on gravel and send you back home,, you aint been on my level;;Look at all these phonies up in here;I dont like the tone thats up in here;If somebody hits you,, you better hit back thats what my grandpa tell me;Ill get you back worse,, Im a man of my words so you better not test me;;[Chorus 2x];Its a vendetta,, youre f*cking with someone who pull out the blammer;Its a vendetta,, were putting your body on top of the blender;Its a vendetta (woo-woo) Its a vendetta [2x]
