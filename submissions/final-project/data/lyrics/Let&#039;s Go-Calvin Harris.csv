;[Produced by J. Cole &amp,; Nate Jones];;[Intro];Freedom or jail,, clips inserted;A baby's being born same time a man is murdered;The beginning and end,, as far as rap goes;It's only natural,, I explain my plateau;And also what defines my name;;[Hook];Yeah,, long live the idols,, may they never be your rivals;Pac was like Jesus,, Nas wrote the Bible;Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin;No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin;;[Verse 1];I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall;My niggas thought they was words,, but it was pictures I saw;And since I wanted to draw,, I used to read 'em in awe;Then he dropped Stillmatic,, rocked the cleanest velour;Fast forward,, who thought that I would meet him on tour?;I'm earnin' stripes now nigga,, got Adidas galore;Backstage I shook his hand,, let him know that he's the man;When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand;No time to soak up the moment though,, cause I was in a jam;Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play;And I was strikin' out for months,, 9th inning feeling fear;Jeter under pressure,, made the biggest hit of my career;But at first,, that wasn't clear,, niggas had no idea;Dion called me when it dropped,, sounded sad but sincere;Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit;Said you the one,, yo why you make that shit;I can't believe I let Nas down;Damn,, my heart sunk to my stomach,, I can't believe I let Nas down;I got defensive on the phone,, resentment was in my tone,, fuck it;;[Hook];;[Verse 2];I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake;I mean,, you made You Owe Me dog,, I thought that you could relate;But while I shot up the charts,, you mean tellin' me;That I was not up to par,, when I followed my heart;Granted,, my heart was tainted by my mind,, I kept on sayin';Where's the hits? You ain't got none;You know Jay would never put your album out without none;And dog,, you know how come;Labels are archaic,, formulaic with their outcomes;They don't know,, they just study the charts;Me,, I study the shows,, the fans,, study their hearts;I had a feelin' I was killin',, and this music we were spillin' out;Would change lives forever,, fuck the label,, put it out;Friday Night Lights blew,, that was classic number 2;Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true;Still no release date from the label,, are they insane;Gucc told me play the game to change the game but on the way;I let Nas down,, I got no one to blame,, I'm ashamed I let Nas down;But this is God's plan,, you could never understand,, fuck it;;[Hook];;[Verse 3];I always believed in the bigger picture;If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open a door;Reintroduce 'em to honesty,, show 'em that they need more;The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars;And so,, I took the fall like the son of the Lord;On the cross,, dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought;For the past decade,, if I should pass please let this be my last essay;Therefore I write from the heart;Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art;But I'm here for a greater purpose,, I knew right from the start;I'm just a man of the people,, not above but equal;And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil;Don't cry mama,, this the life I choose myself;Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself;This is for the nigga that said that hip-hop was dead;I went to Hell to resurrect it,, how could you fail to respect it;Lettin' Nas down,, I got the phone call quietly I mourned dog,, I let Nas down;Yeah,, and on this flight may I never lose sight,, fuck it;;[Hook]
