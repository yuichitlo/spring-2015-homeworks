;[Verse 1];I like fast cars and sharp dreams;Chased a lot of crazy things;Left behind my share of broken pieces;This morning I turned 36;When you just remember half of it;You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus;;[Chorus];I put the rage in a river,, the roll in a thunder;But you kept me from goin' under;When that current got too heavy;I always thought I'd be a heap of metal;In a cloud of smoke,, foot stuck to the pedal;Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy;Fear,, I've had none;What the hell made you wanna love;A man who was gonna die young;;[Verse 2];In the mirror I saw my surprise;Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head;That didn't think he'd live past thirty;If I make it thirty more;It's the brown that you'll be looking for;As you run your fingers through it and say,, Slow down,, honey.;;[Chorus];I put the rage in a river,, the roll in a thunder;But you kept me from goin' under;When that current got too heavy;I always thought I'd be a heap of metal;In a cloud of smoke,, foot stuck to the pedal;Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy;Fear,, I've had none;What the hell made you wanna love;A man who was gonna die young;;[Verse 3];Call it intuition,, or call it crazy;Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies;But I'll gladly stick around if we're together;So baby,, when you bow your head tonight;Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?;And with you I'd like to live forever
