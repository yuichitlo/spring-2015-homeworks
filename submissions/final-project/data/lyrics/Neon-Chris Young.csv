;Cover band ona Flora-Bama deck;A thousand sun-burned souls;Rum-runners and cold Bud Light;A little Friday night summertime rock and roll;Packed in tight,, they were singin' along;I was hanging on the edge of the crowd;When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt;You had me when I turned around;;[Chorus:];Guitars on the Gulf breeze;Smoke rings 'round the neon;Moonlight in your blue eyes;'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on;Just one night to hold you;No,, that ain't what I call fair;But the memories burn in my mind;Like those lighters in the air;Lighters in the air;;That one look led to a walk on the beach;And more kisses than I could count;The best kind of wild and down-home smile;I've ever had these arms around;The ams were screamin' and the people were too;While were slow dancing on our bare feet;Ain't it funny how we missed it all;And still didn't miss a thing?;;[Repeat Chorus];;The thought of you won't let me go;It's been holding on for years;It don't take much to take me back;Everytime I hear;;[Repeat Chorus];;Raise your lighters in the air
