;[Intro];Here it go;;[Verse 1];Well,, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket;So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it;And I won 10 bucks and that was just right;So,, I bought a six pack and a,, a bag of ice;;[Pre-Chorus 1];You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got;It aint like we really need a million dollar yacht cause;;[Chorus 1];We got an inner tube;We got a trailer hitch;Were near the river and far from rich;But we have got each other and gas in the tank;Were laughing all the way to the river bank;;[Verse 2];Still,, can you imagine if we ever struck it;Id go shoot tequila,, take a lime and suck it;And wed tell our bosses they can do the same;Well find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing;;[Pre-Chorus 2];Wed sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy;But till that dream comes true why dont you grab your bikini cause;;[Chorus 1];;[Bridge];However it goes (whatever happens);Weve got it made (in these shades);Cause baby we can float (behind this boat);We can ride away;;[Chorus 2];We got an inner tube;We got a trailer hitch;Were near the river and far from rich;But we have got each other and gas in the tank;And it's a beautiful day;Were laughing all the way,, to the river bank
