;[Verse 1: Outasight];I've been feeling real good,, came a long way from misunderstood;Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home;Cause I was afraid of the truth,, see,, I was scared to admit;That failing was in the back of my head,, comes a point when lying;No longer works so you have to stand up for how you want to live;;[Hook];Tonight is the night,, is the night that were losing control;Tonight is the night,, is the night we set it off;Everybody go whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh;Whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah;Whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh,, whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah;;[Verse 2: Outasight];And I don't know better but as far as I came,, it felt like forever;Seconds turn to hours,, days turn to months,, another year pass by;But don't feel like much so if I got one chance motherfucker;I'mma make yall dance,, I'mma have as much fun as I can;And figure out the rest when I etch out a plan;;[Hook];;[Bridge];I'm feeling better than I ever thought,, it's possible but now I know;I'm feeling better than I ever did,, impossible don't exist,, impossible don't exist;;[Outro];Everybody go whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh;Whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah;Everybody go whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh;Whoa,, whoa,, oh,, oh,, oh,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah,, yeah;Tonight is the night,, is the night that were losing control;Tonight is the night,, is the night we set it off;Tonight is the night,, is the night that were losing control;Tonight is the night,, is the night we set it off
