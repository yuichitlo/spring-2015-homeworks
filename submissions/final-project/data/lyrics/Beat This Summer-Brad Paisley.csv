;[Intro];Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ho;;[Verse 1];Like the first wheel goes around and around;Well the trouble with up is there's always a down;First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk;There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks;;[Verse 2];But the sun keeps settin',, the days go fast;And the sand the beach is like an hourglass;I can just feel it all slipping away;And babe I can already say that;;[Chorus];As long I live,, whatever I do;As great as it is,, you know what's a bummer;I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you;Baby it's true;The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet;I ain't gonna beat,, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you;;[Verse 3];Before you know it it's all gonna stop;They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops;Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air;You won't find a tan line anywhere;;[Verse 4];Baby I know that it ain't over yet;So let's make the most of what we have left;But it's hard living for this moment we're in and;Knowing it's all gonna end...;;[Chorus];As long I live,, whatever I do (Whatever I do);As great as it is,, you know what's a bummer;I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you;Baby it's true;The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet;I ain't gonna beat,, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you;;[Verse 5];Yeah looking at you,, girl,, standing there;Got your wayfarers on and the sun in your hair;And just like the song in a seashell,, you'll be stuck in my mind;Bouncing around in my head;And baby I can tell;;[Chorus];As long I live (as long as I live),, whatever I do (Whatever I do);As great as it is,, you know what's a bummer;I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you;Baby it's true;The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet;I ain't gonna beat,, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you
