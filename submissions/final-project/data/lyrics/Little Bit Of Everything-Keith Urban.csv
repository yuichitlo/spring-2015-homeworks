;[Verse 1];I wish I could take a cab down to the creek;And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree;Smoke and drink once in a while;Somehow itd be good for me;I want a cool chick thatll cook for me;Butll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet;And do what I want when I want;And shell do it with me;;[Chorus];I dont need too much of nothing;I just wanna sing a little chill song;Get my groove on;Pour something strong;Down in my drink;Oh,, I know;That I dont need a whole lot of anything;I just want a little bit of everything;Na na na na,, na na na na;I just want a little bit of everything;Na na na na,, na na na na;;[Verse 2];Now I dont need a garage full of cars;But Ill take a whole box of Cuban cigars;And Ill smoke em nice and slow;Like they were good for me;Dont need a ranch or a big piece of land;But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands;A big ole couch in a big ol' room;Still feels lonely when its just you;Yes it does;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];A little bit of everything;Under the sun;So,, when I kick back basking in it;Ill be okay with what Ive done;Still having fun;;[Chorus]
