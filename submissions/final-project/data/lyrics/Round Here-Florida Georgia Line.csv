;[Verse 1];Hammer and a nail,, stacking them bales;I'm dog tired by the 5:00 hour;But I'm ready to raise some hell;And Jesse's getting ready,, I'm gassing up the Chevy;I'm gonna pick her up at six;I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear;That her mama never fixed;;[Chorus];The moon comes up and the sun goes down;We find a little spot on the edge of town;Twist off,, sip a little,, pass it around;Dance in the dust,, turn the radio up;That fireball whiskey whispers;Temptation in my ear;It's a feelin' alright Saturday night;And that's how we do it 'round here;Yeah that's how we do it 'round here;;[Verse 2];Mud on the grips,, wild cherry on her lips;I've been working and trying and flirting and dying;For an all night kinda kiss;Country on the boombox,, candles on the tool box;I'm doing everything right,, got the country boy charm;Turned all the way on tonight;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Yeah that's how we do it round here;Yeah that's how we do it round here
