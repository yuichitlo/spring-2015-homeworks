;[Verse 1];I bet this time of night youre still up;I bet youre tired from a long,, hard week;I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window,, looking out at the city;And I bet sometimes you wonder about me;;[Chorus];And I just want to tell you;It takes everything in me not to call you;And I wish I could run to you;And I hope you know that;Everytime I dont;I almost do,, I almost do;;[Verse 2];I bet you think I either moved on or hate you;Cause each time you reach out theres no reply;I bet it never,, ever occurred to you that I cant say hello to you;And risk another goodbye;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];We made quite a mess,, babe;Its probably better off this way;And I confess,, babe;That in my dreams youre touching my face;And asking me if I want to try again with you;And I almost do;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I bet this time of night youre still up;I bet youre tired from a long,, hard week;I bet youre sittin' in your chair by the window,, looking out at the city;And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
