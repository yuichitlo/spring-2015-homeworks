;[Verse 1];The sea wants to kiss the golden shore;The sunlight warms your skin;All the beauty that's been lost before;Wants to find us again;;I can't fight you anymore;It's you I'm fighting for;The sea throws rock together;But time leaves us polished stones;;[Chorus];We can't fall any further;If we can't feel ordinary love;And we cannot reach any higher;If we can't deal with ordinary love;;[Verse 2];Birds fly high in the summer sky;And rest on the breeze;The same wind will take care of you and I;We'll build our house in the trees;;Your heart is on my sleeve;Did you put there with a magic marker;For years I would believe;That the world couldn't wash it away;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Are we tough enough;For ordinary love;;[Chorus x2]
