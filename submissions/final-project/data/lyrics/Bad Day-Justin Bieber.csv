;[Verse 1];No I didn't think you would let me down;That easy;Oh no girl;And I didn't think;It was over,, until you walked away;Like it was nothing baby;;[Verse 2];And that moment was so hard for me to breathe;Yeah,, because you took away the biggest part of me;Life was so unpredictable;Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone;Oh no;Didn't waste any time,, but you had already made up your mind;No sympathy cause I was out of line,, oh yeah;;[Verse 3];But I didn't think you would let me down;That easy,, yeah oh no girl;And I didn't think;It was over,, until you walked away;Like it was nothing girl;It was a bad day;I knew I was wrong;But you could've said goodbye baby;;[Outro];It was a bad day;Now I'm like whoah;It was a bad day;It was a bad day
