;[Verse 1];Play the Lotto,, you might win it;It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison;Something's in the air,, something's in the air;It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it;Take your last shot,, you know you're gonna hit it;Something's in the air,, something's in the air;Woah-oh;;[Chorus];Something big,, I feel it happening;Out of my control;Pushing,, pulling,, in its gravity;Feel it in my bones;Like oh,, woah,, woah,, oh,, woah;Something big,, I feel it happening;Oh,, woah,, woah,, oh,, woah;Something big;;[Verse 2];It's like the feeling when you're about to win the medal;And you worked so hard,, that you knew you wouldn't settle;Hands are in the air,, hands are in the air;When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen;It's like an anthem that the whole world's singin';Hands are in the air,, hands are in the air;Woah-oh;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Woah!;Yeah,, yeah;If we stomp our feet,, the ground will shake;If we clap our hands,, the walls will break;Yell so loud,, won't forget our names;Because something big is happening;Take this spark,, and start a fire;Raise this up,, we're feeling higher;You can't tell us anything;Something big is happening;;[Chorus];;...Is happening;Oh
