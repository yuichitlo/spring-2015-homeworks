;[Verse 1];Stop me on the corner;I swear you hit me like a vision;I,, I,, I wasn't expecting;But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go with it;Don't you blink you might miss it;See we got a right to just love it or leave it;You find it and keep it;Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say;;[Chorus];Oh,, this is how it starts,, lightning strikes the heart;It goes off like a gun,, brighter than the sun;Oh,, we could be the stars,, falling from the sky;Shining how we want,, brighter than the sun;;[Verse 2];I've never seen it,, I found this love,, I'm gonna feed it;You better believe,, I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had;Cause you're so damn beautiful;Read it,, it's signed and delivered let's seal it;Boy we go together like peanuts and paydays and Marley and reggae;And everybody needs to get a chance to say;;[Chorus][2x];;[Verse 3];Everything is like a white out,, cause we shika-shika a shine down;Even when the,, when the light's out but I can see you glow;Got my head up in the rafters,, got me happy ever after;Never felt this way before,, ain't felt this way before;;[Bridge];I swear you hit me like a vision;I,, I,, I wasn't expecting;But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?;;[Chorus][3x];;[Bridge];Brighter than the sun[3x];Oho,, yeah,, oho;;[Outro][4x];Oh,, this is how it starts,, lightning strikes the heart;It goes off like a gun,, brighter than the sun
