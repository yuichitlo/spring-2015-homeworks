;Oh Sweet Lorraine;I wish we could do all the good times;Over again;;Oh sweet Lorraine;Life only goes around;Once;But never again;Oh,, sweet Lorraine;I wish we could do;All the good times;Over again;;[The good times] x 3;All over again;;But the memories always;Linger on;Oh sweet Lorraine;No,, I don't want to move on;Oh the memories;Always linger on;Oh Sweet Lorraine;That's why I wrote you this song
