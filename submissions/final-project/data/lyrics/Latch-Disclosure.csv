;[Intro];(Never 3x);;[Verse 1];You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down;You,, you enchant me even when you're not around;If there are boundaries,, I will try to knock them down;Im latching on,, babe,, now I know what I have found;;[Bridge];I feel we're close enough;I wanna lock in your love;I think we're close enough;Could I lock in your love,, baby?;;[Chorus];Now I've got you in my space;I won't let go of you;Got you shackled in my embrace;I'm latching on to you;;[Verse 2];I'm so encaptured,, got me wrapped up in your touch;Feel so enamored,, hold me tight within your clutch;How do you do it? You got me losing every breath;What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest?;;[Bridge x2];;[Chorus x2];;[Outro];I'm latching on to you;I won't let go of you;I'm latching on to you;I won't let go of you;I won't let go,, I won't let go;I won't let go,, I won't let go
