;[Verse 1];I have been thinking bout you all day baby;Waiting on that sun to go down;What you say I pick you up after work;Slide over,, well slip out to the outskirts of town;Got a blanket and a fifth of comfort;A little something to knock off the edge;It is supposed to get a little cool tonight;Looks like I am going to have to hold you tight yeah;;[Chorus];About a mile off old mill road;In that spot nobody knows;Park the truck and we take off running;Hurry up,, girl I hear it coming;Got a moon and a billion stars;Sound of steel and old box cars;The thought of you is driving me insane;Come on baby lets go listen to the night train;;[Verse 2];Yeah I hope it is going to be a long one;If we are lucky it is moving slow;Would not mind if it lasted all night;Lying next to you on that hillside lets go;;[Chorus];;Let us go listen to the night train;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Let us go listen to the night train
