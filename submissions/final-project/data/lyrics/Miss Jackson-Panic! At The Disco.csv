;[Chorus 1] (Lolo);Climbing out back the door,, didn't leave a mark;No one knows its you,, Miss Jackson;Found another victim;But no ones going to find Miss Jackson;;[Verse 1];You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now;You move in circles hoping no ones going to find out;But were so lucky;;Kiss the ring and let them bow down;Looking for the time of your life (going to find out);A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud;;A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown;But back away from the water,, babe,, you might drown;The party isn't over tonight;;[Pre-Chorus];Hey,, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?;Hey,, out the back door,, goddamn;But I love her anyway;I love her anyway,, I love her anyway;Out the back door,, goddamn;But I love her anyway;;[Chorus 2];Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, are you nasty?;Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, are you nasty?;Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, Miss Jackson,, are you nasty? Are you nasty?;I love her anyway;Oh,, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?;Oh,, out the back door,, goddamn;But I love her anyway;;[Verse 2];Way down until the fire finally dies out;You've got them wrapped around your finger;Watch them fall down;Theres something beautiful and tragic in the fall out;Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out);;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus 2];;[Chorus 1];;[Bridge];I love her anyway;;[Chorus 2]
