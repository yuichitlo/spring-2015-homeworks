;[Verse 1];You wont find him drinking under tables;Rolling dice or staying out til three;You wont ever find him be unfaithful;You will find him,, youll find him next to me;You wont find him tryna chase the devil;For money,, fame,, for power out of greed;You won't ever find him where the rest go;You will find him,, youll find him next to me;;[Chorus 1];Next to me  wooh hooo;Next to me  wooh hooo;Next to me  wooh hooo;You will find him,, youll find him next to me;;[Verse 2];When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished;And I cant seem to find no help or love for free;I know theres no need for me to panic;Cause Ill find him,, Ill find him next to me;When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing;And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe;When all I needs a hand to stop the tears from falling;I will find him,, Ill find him next to me;;[Chorus 2];Next to me  wooh hooo;Next to me  wooh hooo;Next to me  wooh hooo;I will find him,, Ill find him next to me;;[Bridge];When the end has come and buildings falling down fast;When weve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea;When everyone has lost their heads around us;You will find him,, youll find him next to me;;[Chorus 1] x2
