;[Verse 1];I see main street closing;Miles of for sale signs;And them fields aint growing;Fast enough to get us by;I feel the sweet release;Of a friday night;For a couple of hours we can run this town;Till it runs dry;;[Chorus];Tip it on back,, make it feel good;Sip a little more than you know you should;Let the smoke roll,, off your lips;Let it all go whatever it is;And tip it on back;;[Verse 2];So grab the girl you came with;And set her world on fire;And watch her sway and singing to the music;Until its all alright;Yeah;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];I dont wanna lose this feeling;And i dont wanna close my eyes;I dont wanna remember what im here to forget tonight;So tip it on back;;[Chorus];;[Verse 4];Yeah,, i dont wanna lose this feeling;I dont wanna close my eyes;I dont wanna remember what im here to forget tonight;So tip it on back;Just tip it on back;;[Outro];Feel the sweet release of a friday night;For a couple of hours we can run this town;Till it runs dry;Tip it on back
