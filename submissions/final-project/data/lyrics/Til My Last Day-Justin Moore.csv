;[Verse 1];People say I'm just a rough boy;I ain't no good for you girl;It's a dead end street,, trying to love me;Yeah,, I'll wreck your world;I can see why they're all talking;Looking back at my past;I've got a bad name but a man can change;I'm living proof of that;;[Chorus];Till my last day,, till my last breath;Of everyone that can,, I can love you the best;Till my last day,, I'll be loving you;All the way up till they lay me down;Six feet under the cold hard ground;Till my last day,, I'll be loving you;;[Verse 2];Baby I might meet all my friends;Shoot the bull,, have a beer or two;But you know I'll be the first one to leave;In a hurry to get to you;Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes;I found a place to rest;Don't ever doubt that I'll be around;And baby don't you ever forget;;[Chorus][x2]
