;[Verse 1];You shout it out,, but I can't hear a word you say;I'm talking loud,, not saying much;I'm criticized,, but all your bullets ricochet;You shoot me down,, but I get up;;[Pre-Chorus];I'm bulletproof,, nothing to lose;Fire away,, fire away;Ricochet,, you take your aim;Fire away,, fire away;;[Chorus];You shoot me down,, but I won't fall;I am titanium;You shoot me down,, but I won't fall;I am titanium;;[Verse 2];Cut me down,, but it's you who'll have further to fall;Ghost town and haunted love;Raise your voice,, sticks and stones may break my bones;I'm talking loud,, not saying much;;[Pre-Chorus &amp,; Chorus];;[Bridge];Stone hard,, machine gun;Fired at the ones who run;Stone hard,, as bulletproof glass;;[Chorus x2]
