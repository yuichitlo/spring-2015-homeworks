;[Produced by Nathan Chapman];;[Verse 1];I'm walking fast through the traffic lights;Busy streets and busy lives;And all we know is touch and go;We are alone with our changing minds;We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds,, or fades in time;;[Pre-Chorus];And I never saw you coming;And Ill never be the same;;[Verse 2];You come around and the armor falls;Pierce the room like a cannon ball;Now all we know,, is dont let go;We are alone just you and me;Up in your room and our slates are clean;Just twin fire signs,, four blue eyes;;So you were never a saint;And I've love in shades of wrong;We learn to live with the pain;Mosaic broken hearts;But this love is brave and wild;;[Chorus];And I never saw you coming;And Ill never be the same;This is a state of grace;This is the worthwhile fight;Love is a ruthless game;Unless you play it good and right;These are the hands of fate;Youre my Achilles heel;This is the golden age of something good;And right and real;;[Bridge];And I never saw you coming;And Ill never be the same;And I never saw you coming;And Ill never be the same;This is a state of grace;This is a worthwhile fight;Love is a ruthless game;Unless you play it good and right
