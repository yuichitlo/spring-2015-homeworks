;[Verse 1];I tried to find you at the bottom of a bottle;Laying down on the bathroom floor;My loneliness was rattling the windows;You said you don't want me anymore;;[Chorus];And you left me standing on the corner crying;Feeling like a fool for trying;I don't even remember why i'm wasting all these tears on you;I wish I could erase our memory;Cause you didn't give a damn about me;Oh finally i'm through wasting all these tears on you;;[Verse 2];You ain't worth another sleepless night;And I'll do everything I gotta do to get you off my mind;Cause what you wanted I couldn't give;What you did boy I'll never forget;;[Chorus] x2;And you left me standing on the corner crying;Feeling like a fool for trying;I don't even remember why i'm wasting all these tears on you;I wish I could erase our memory;Cause you didn't give a damn about me;Oh finally i'm through wasting all these tears on you
