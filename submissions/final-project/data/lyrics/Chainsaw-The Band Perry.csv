;[Verse 1];We scratched our names;In that oak tree;Because I loved you;And you loved me;A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it;Carved in the bark with an arrow through it;I came out here to see it one more time;;[Chorus];And I got my chainsaw;Oh you know it's got to go,, it's such a shame you all;But I ain't going to be happy until those names fall;And I'm sitting on a stump;Love is shady;Love is tragic;It's hard to bury the hatchet;Holding a chainsaw;;[Verse 2];I guess all those years;They don't mean a thing;Now I can't wait;To count those rings;Nothing left of us but dust and splinters;A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter;Because I don't have you;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];I remember what you said that night;That you would love me for the rest of your life;We wrote forever with a pocketknife;But forever's going down tonight;;[Chorus];I got my chainsaw;Oh you know it's got to go,, it's such a shame doll;But I ain't going to be happy until those names fall;And I'm sitting on a stump;Love is shady;Love is tragic;It's hard to bury the hatchet;Holding a chainsaw
