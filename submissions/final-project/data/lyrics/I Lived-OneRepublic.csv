;[Verse 1];Hope when you take that jump;You don't feel the fall;Hope when the water rises;You built a wall;Hope when the crowd screams out;It's screaming your name;Hope if everybody runs;You choose to stay;Hope that you fall in love;And it hurts so bad;The only way you can know;Is give it all you have;And I hope that you don't suffer;But take the pain...;Hope when the moment comes;You'll say;;[Hook];I...I did it all;I...I did it all;I owned every second that this world could give;I saw so many places;The things that I did;Yeah,, worth every broken bone;I swear I lived;;[Verse 2];Hope that you spend your days;But they all add up;And when that sun goes down;Hope you raise your cup;Oh,, oh;I wish that I could witness;All your joy and all your pain;But until my moment comes;I'll say;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x4);Worth every broken bone;I swear I lived;Worth every broken bone;I swear I;;[Hook];;[Outro];Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2);I swear I lived;Oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh (x2)
