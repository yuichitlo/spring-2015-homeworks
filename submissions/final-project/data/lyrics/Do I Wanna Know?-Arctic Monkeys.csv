;[Verse 1];Have you got colour in your cheeks?;Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type;That sticks around like summat in your teeth?;Are there some aces up your sleeve?;Have you no idea that you're in deep?;I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week;How many secrets can you keep?;Cause there's this tune I found;That makes me think of you somehow;And I play it on repeat;Until I fall asleep;Spilling drinks on my settee;;[Refrain];(Do I wanna know);If this feeling flows both ways?;(Sad to see you go);Was sorta hoping that youd stay;(Baby,, we both know);That the nights were mainly made;For saying things that you cant say tomorrow day;;[Chorus];Crawlin' back to you;Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?;Cause I always do;Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new;Now I've thought it through;Crawling back to you;;[Verse 2];So have you got the guts?;Been wondering if your heart's still open;And if so,, I wanna know what time it shuts;Simmer down and pucker up;I'm sorry to interrupt,, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp;Of trying to kiss you;I don't know if you feel the same as I do;We could be together if you wanted to;;[Refrain];;[Chorus];;[Refrain];;(Do I wanna know);If this feeling flows both ways?;Too busy bein' yours to fall;(Sad to see you go);Ever thought of callin' darlin'?;(Do I wanna know);If this feeling flows both ways?;Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
