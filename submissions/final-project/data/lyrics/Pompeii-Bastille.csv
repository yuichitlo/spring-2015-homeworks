;[Intro];Eh eheu eheu! (8x);;[Verse 1];I was left to my own devices;Many days fell away with nothing to show;;[Pre-Chorus];And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love;Great clouds roll over the hills;Bringing darkness from above;;[Chorus];But if you close your eyes;Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?;And if you close your eyes;Does it almost feel like you've been here before?;How am I going to be an optimist about this?;How am I going to be an optimist about this?;;[Verse 2];We were caught up and lost in all of our vices;In your pose,, as the dust,, settled around us;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;[Bridge](2x);Oh,, where do we begin?;The rubble or our sins?;;[Pre-Chorus + Chorus];;If you close your eyes;Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?;And if you close your eyes;Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
