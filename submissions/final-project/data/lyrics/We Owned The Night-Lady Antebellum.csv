;[Verse 1];Tell me have you ever wanted;Someone so much it hurts?;Your lips keep trying to speak;But you just can't find the words;Well I had this dream once;I held it in my head;;[Verse 2];She was the purest beauty;But not the common kind;She had a way about her;That made you feel alive;And for a moment;We made the world stand still;;Yeah,, we owned the night;;[Verse 3];You had me dim the lights,;;You danced just like a child;The wine spilled on your dress;;And all you did was smile;Yeah,, it was perfect;I hold it in my mind;;Yeah,, we owned the night;;[Verse 4];When the summer rolls around;And the sun starts sinking down;I still remember you;Oh,, I remember you;And I wonder where you are;;Are you looking at those same stars again?;Do you remember when?;;[Verse 5];We woke under a blanket;All tangled up in skin;Not knowing in that moment;We'd never speak again;But it was perfect,;;I never will forget;When we owned the night;;Yeah,, we owned the night
