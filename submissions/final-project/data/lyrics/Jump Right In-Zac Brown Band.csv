;[Pre-Chorus];The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby;;[Verse 1];Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling;And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning;And the ship is off to sea;And the wake is a churning;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];You can jump right in;Let the music pull you in;You can jump right in;Oh,, and lose yourself again;As the southern wind sings again an island lullaby;;[Verse 2];There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it;And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain;The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Bridge];You can find me where the music meets the ocean;If you get the notion;Stop on by and play a while;Simple tune to get your love light glowing;Keep your heart wide open;Disappear just like the tide;Let it roll on by;;[Chorus]
