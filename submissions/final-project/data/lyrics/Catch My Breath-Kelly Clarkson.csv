;[Verse 1];I don't wanna be left behind;Distance was a friend of mine;Catching my breath in web of lies;I've spent most of my life;Riding waves,, playing acrobat;Shadowboxing the other half;Learning how to react;I've spent most of my time;;[Pre-Hook];Catching my breath,, letting it go,, turning my cheek for the sake of this show;Now that you know,, this is my life,, I won't be told what's suppose to be right;;[Hook];Catch my breath,, no one can hold me back,, i ain't got time for that;Catch my breath,, won't let then get me down,, it's all so simple now;;[Verse 2];Addicted to the love I found;Heavy heart,, now a weightless cloud;Making time for the ones that count;I'll spend the rest of my time;Laughing hard with the windows down;Leaving footprints all over town;Keeping faith karma comes around;I will spend the rest of my life;;[Pre-Hook];;[Hook];Catch my breath,, no one can hold me back,, I ain't got time for that;Catch my breath,, won't let them get me down,, it's all so simple now;You helped me see;The beauty in everything;;[Pre-Hook][x2];(Catch my breath);;[Hook];;[Pre-Hook];;[Hook]
