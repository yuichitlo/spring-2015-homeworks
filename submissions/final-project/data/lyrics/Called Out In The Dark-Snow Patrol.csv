;It's like we just can't help ourselves;Cause we don't know how to back down;We were called out to the streets;We were called out to the towns;How the heavens they opened up;Like arms of dazzling gold;With our rain-washed histories;Well,, we do not need to be told;;[Chorus];Show me now;Show me the arms aloft;Every eye ,, trained on a different star;This [my chick or magic?];This drunken semaphore,, and I;We are listening;And we're not blind;This is your life,, this your time;We are listening,, and were not blind;This is your life,, this is your time;;I was called out in the dark;By a choir of beautiful cheats;And as the kids took back the parks;You and I were left with the streets;;[Chorus];;We are listening;And we're not blind;This is your life,, this is your time;We are listening;And we're not blind;This is your life,, this is your time
