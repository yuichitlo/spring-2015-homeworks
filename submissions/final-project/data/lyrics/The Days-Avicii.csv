;[Verse 1];Under the tree where the grass don't grow;We made a promise to never get old;You had the chances and you took it on me;And I made a promise that I couldn't keep;;[Pre-Chorus];Heartache,, heartbreaks all over town;But something flipped like a switch when you came around;And I'm in pieces,, pick me up and put me together;(Oh whoa oh);;[Chorus];These are the days we've been waiting for;On days like these who could ask for more;Keep them coming 'cuz we're not done yet;These are the days we won't regret;These are the days we won't forget;These are the days we've been waiting for;Rattle the cage and slam that door;And the world is calling us and not just yet;These are the days we won't regret;These are the days we won't forget;;[Verse 2];Out on the midnight the wild ones out;Last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel;We used to believe we were stars aligned;You made a wish and I fell out of;;[Pre-Chorus];Time flew,, cut through all over town;You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around;But I'm in pieces,, pick me up and put me together;(Oh whoa oh);;[Chorus];These are the days we've been waiting for;Neither of us knows what's in store;You just roll your window down and place your beds;These are the days we won't regret;These are the days we'll never forget;;[Outro] (x2);And these are the days (these are the days)
