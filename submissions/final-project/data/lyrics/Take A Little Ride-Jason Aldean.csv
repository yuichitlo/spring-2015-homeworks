;[Verse 1];Been going round and round all day;Bailing some hay and stacking it all up;Cannot wait for the sun to go down;Roll into town,, shine the old truck up;Swing by the quick stop;Grab a little Shiner Bock;[Another version says Grab a couple Rocky Tops in reference to Coors beer];Then ease on out your way;To your place around 8 o'clock;;[Chorus];Well I am just ready to ride this Chevy;Ride this Chevy down a little back road;Slide your pretty little self on over;Get a little closer,, turn up the radio;Put your pretty pink toes on the dash;Lean your seat back;Man I swear there is nothing looks better than that;Sweet tan,, little thing with nothing to do;I want to take a little ride with you;;[Verse 2];I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs;Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight;Drop the tailgate down on a turn road;Watch the corn grow,, baby that is a good night;Anyone from the heartland is going to understand;What I am talking about right now;There is no doubt,, we got a game plan;;[Chorus] [x2]
