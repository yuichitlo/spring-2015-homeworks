;[Verse 1];What have I done to feel these fists from heaven?;I have to question;Have I done wrong?;What's with this reaction?;Am I a mad man?;If I walked on water would I sink or drown?;I think I'm lost,, could I ever be found?;If I held your Bible will my soul set fire?;When that dark day comes will I be up by your side?;;[Chorus];Oh,, when this world comes crashing down;I'll be,, I'll be the soldier,, I'll be the soldier;Oh,, when this place falls to the ground;I'll be,, I'll be the soldier,, I'll be the soldier;;[Bridge];I guess it's you,, hey,, I guess it's you;That makes me be the bad one;That makes me be the mad one;I guess it's you,, hey,, I guess it's you;That puts these thoughts inside me;It's like you wanna hide me;Ooh yeah,, I guess it's you;;[Verse 2];Have I done wrong?;What's with this reaction?;Am I a mad man?;;[Chorus]
