;[Verse 1];Straight off the plane to a new hotel;Just touched down,, you could never tell;Big house party with a crowded kitchen;People talk shh but we don't listen;;[Pre-Chorus];Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please;Way too many people in the Addison Lee;Now I'm at the age when I know what I need,, oh whoa;;[Chorus];Midnight memories,, oh oh oh;Baby you and me;Stumblin' in the street;Singing,, singing,, singing,, singing;Midnight memories,, oh oh oh;Baby where we go?;Never say no;Just do it,, do it,, do it,, do it;;[Verse 2];5 foot something with the skinny jeans;Don't look back,, baby follow me;I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way;Same old shit but a different day;;[Pre-Chorus];[Chorus];;[Bridge];You and me and all our friends;I don't care how much we spend;Baby this is what the night is for,, or,, or;I know nothing's making sense;For tonight lets just pretend;I don't wanna stop till get me oh;;[Chorus]
