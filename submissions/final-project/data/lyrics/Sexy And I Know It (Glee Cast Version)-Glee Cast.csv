;1;;;Around quitting time,, Tod Hackett heard a great din on the road outside;his office. The groan of leather mingled with the jangle of iron and over;all beat the tattoo of a thousand hooves. He hurried to the window.;;An army of cavalry and foot was passing. It moved like a. mob,; its lines;broken,, as though fleeing from some terrible defeat. The dolmans of the;hussars,, the heavy shakos of the guards,, Hanoverian light horse,, with;their fiat leather caps and flowing red plumes,, were all jumbled together;in bobbing disorder. Behind the cavalry came the infantry,, a wild sea of;waving sabretaches,, sloped muskets,, crossed shoulder belts and swinging;cartridge boxes.. Tod recognized the scarlet infantry of England with;their white shoulder pads,, the black infantry of the Duke of Brunswick,,;the French grenadiers with their enormous white gaiters,, the Scotch with;bare knees under plaid skirts.;;While he watched,, a little fat man,, wearing a cork sun-helmet,, polo shirt;and knickers,, darted around the corner of the building in pursuit of the;army.;;Stage Nine--you bastards--Stage Nine! he screamed through a small;megaphone.;;The cavalry put spur to their horses and the infantry broke into a;dogtrot. The little man in the cork hat ran after them,, shaking his fist;and cursing.;;Tod watched until they had disappeared behind half a Mississippi;steamboat,, then put away his pencils and drawing board,, and left the;office. On the sidewalk outside the studio he stood for a moment trying;to decide whether to walk home or take a streetcar. He had been in;Hollywood less than three months and still found it a very exciting;place,, but he was lazy and didn't like to walk. He decided to take the;streetcar as far as Vine Street and walk the rest of the way.;;A talent scout for National Films had brought Tod to the Coast after;seeing some of his drawings in an exhibit of undergraduate work at the;Yale School of Fine Arts. He had been hired by telegram. If the scout had;met Tod,, he probably wouldn't have sent him to Hollywood to learn set and;costume designing. His large,, sprawling body,, his slow blue eyes and;sloppy grin made him seem completely without talent,, almost doltish in;fact.;;Yes,, despite his appearance,, he was really a very complicated young man;with a whole set of personalities,, one inside the other like a nest of;Chinese boxes. And The Burning of Los Angeles,, a picture he was soon to;paint,, definitely proved he had talent.;;He left the car at Vine Street. As he walked along,, he examined the;evening crowd. A great many of the people wore sports clothes which were;not really sports clothes. Their sweaters,, knickers,, slacks,, blue flannel;jackets with brass buttons were fancy dress. The fat lady in the yachting;cap was going shopping,, not boating,; the man in the Norfolk jacket and;Tyrolean hat was returning,, not from a mountain,, but an insurance office,;;and the girl in slacks and sneaks with a bandanna around her head had;just left a switchboard,, not a tennis court.;;Scattered among these masquerades were people of a different type. Their;clothing was somber and badly cut,, bought from mail-order houses. While;the others moved rapidly,, darting into stores and cocktail bars,, they;loitered on the corners or stood with their backs to the shop windows and;stared at everyone who passed. When their stare was returned,, their eyes;filled with hatred. At this time Tod knew very little about them except;that they had come to California to die.;;He was determined to learn much more. They were the people he felt he;must paint. He would never again do a fat red barn,, old stone wall or;sturdy Nantucket fisherman. From the moment he had seen them,, he had;known that,, despite his race,, training and heritage,, neither Winslow;Homer nor Thomas Ryder could be his masters and he turned to Goya and;Daumier.;;He had learned this just in time. During his last year in art school,, he;had begun to think that he might give up painting completely. The;pleasures he received from the problems of composition and color had;decreased as his facility had increased and he had realized that he was;going the way of all his classmates,, toward illustration or mere;handsomeness. When the Hollywood job had come along,, he had grabbed it;despite the arguments of his Mends who were certain that he was selling;out and would never paint again.;;He reached the end of Vine Street and began the climb into Pinyon Canyon.;Night had started to fall.;;The edges of the trees burned with a pale violet light and their centers;gradually turned from deep purple to black. The same violet piping,, like;a Neon tube,, outlined the tops of the ugly,, hump-backed hills and they;were almost beautiful.;;But not even the soft wash of dusk could help the houses. Only dynamite;would be of any use against the Mexican ranch houses,, Samoan huts,,;Mediterranean villas,, Egyptian and Japanese temples,, Swiss chalets,, Tudor;cottages,, and every possible combination of these styles that lined the;slopes of the canyon.;;When he noticed that they were all of plaster,, lath and paper,, he was;charitable and blamed their shape on the materials used. Steel,, stone and;brick curb a builder's fancy a little,, forcing him to distribute his;stresses and weights and to keep his corners plumb,, but plaster and paper;know no law,, not even that of gravity.;;On the corner of La Huerta Road was a miniature Rhine castle with;tarpaper turrets pierced for archers. Next to it was a little highly;colored shack with domes and minarets out of the Arabian Nights. Again he;was charitable. Both houses were comic,, but he didn't laugh. Their desire;to startle was so eager and guileless.;;It is hard to laugh at the need for beauty and romance,, no matter how;tasteless,, even horrible,, the results of that need are. But it is easy to;sigh. Few things are sadder than the truly monstrous.;;;2;;;The house he lived in was a nondescript affair called the San Bernardino;Arms. It was an oblong three stories high,, the back and sides of which;were of plain,, unpainted stucco,, broken by even rows of unadorned;windows. The facade was the color of diluted mustard and its windows,, all;double,, were framed by pink Moorish columns which supported turnip-shaped;lintels.;;His room was on the third floor,, but he paused for a moment on the;landing of the second. It was on that floor that Faye Greener lived,, in;208. When someone laughed in one of the apartments he started guiltily;and continued upstairs.;;As he opened his door a card fluttered to the floor. Honest Abe Kusich,,;it said in large type,, then underneath in smaller italics were several;endorsements,, printed to look like press notices.;;...the Lloyds of Hollywood--Stanley Rose.;;Abe's word is better than Morgan's bonds--Gail Brenshaw.;;On the other side was a penciled message:;;Kingpin fourth,, Solitair sixth. You can make some real dough on those;nags.;;After opening the window,, he took off his jacket and lay down on the bed.;Through the window he could see a square of enameled sky and a spray of;eucalyptus. A light breeze stirred its long,, narrow leaves,, making them;show first their green side,, then their silver one.;;He began to think of Honest Abe Kusich in order not to think of Faye;Greener. He felt comfortable and wanted to remain that way.;;Abe was an important figure in a set of lithographs called The Dancers;on which Tod was working. He was one of the dancers. Faye Greener was;another and her father,, Harry,, still another. They changed with each;plate,, but the group of uneasy people who formed their audience remained;the same. They stood staring at the performers in just the way that they;stared at the masqueraders on Vine Street. It was their stare that drove;Abe and the others to spin crazily and leap into the air with twisted;backs like hooked trout.;;Despite the sincere indignation that Abe's grotesque depravity aroused in;him,, he welcomed his company. The little man excited him and in that way;made him feel certain of his need to paint.;;He had first met Abe when he was living on Ivar Street,, in a hotel called;the Chateau Mirabella. Another name for Ivar Street was Lysol Alley,,;and the Chateau was mainly inhabited by hustlers,, their managers,,;trainers and advance agents.;;In the morning its halls reeked of antiseptic. Tod didn't like this odor.;Moreover,, the rent was high because it included police protection,, a;service for which he had no need. He wanted to move,, but inertia and the;fact that he didn't know where to go kept him in the Chateau until he met;Abe. The meeting was accidental.;;He was on the way to his room late one night when he saw what he supposed;was a pile of soiled laundry lying in front of the door across the hall;from his own. Just as he was passing it,, the bundle moved and made a;peculiar noise. He struck a match,, thinking it might be a dog wrapped in;a blanket. When the light flared up,, he saw it was a tiny man.;;The match went out and he hastily lit another. It was a male dwarf rolled;up in a woman's flannel bathrobe. The round thing at the end was his;slightly hydrocephalic head. A slow,, choked snore bubbled from it.;;The hall was cold and draughty. Tod decided to wake the man and stirred;him with his toe. He groaned and opened his eyes.;;You oughtn't to sleep there.;;The hell you say,, said the dwarf,, closing his eyes again. You'll catch;cold.;;This friendly observation angered the little man still more.;;I want my clothes! he bellowed.;;The bottom of the door next to which he was lying filled with light. Tod;decided to take a chance and knock. A few seconds later a woman opened;it part way. What the hell do you want? she demanded. There's a;friend of yours out here who... Neither of them let him finish.;;So what! she barked,, slamming the door.;;Give me my clothes,, you bitch! roared the dwarf.;;She opened the door again and began to hurl things into the ball. A;jacket and trousers,, a shirt,, socks,, shoes and underwear,, a tie and hat;followed each other through the air in rapid succession. With each;article went a special curse.;;Tod whistled with amazement.;;Some gal!;;You bet,, said the dwarf. A lollapalooza--all slut and a yard wide.;;He laughed at his own joke,, using a high-pitched cackle more dwarflike;than anything that had come from him so far,, then struggled to his feet;and arranged the voluminous robe so that he could walk without tripping.;Tod helped him gather his scattered clothing.;;Say,, mister,, he asked,, could I dress in your place?;;Tod let him into his bathroom. While waiting for him to reappear,, he;couldn't help imagining what had happened in the woman's apartment. He;began to feel sorry for having interfered. But when the dwarf came out;wearing his hat,, Tod felt better.;;The little man's hat fixed almost everything. That year Tyrolean hats;were being worn a great deal along Hollywood Boulevard and the dwarf's;was a fine specimen. It was the proper magic green color and had a high,,;conical crown. There should have been a brass buckle on the front,, but;otherwise it was quite perfect.;;The rest of his outfit didn't go well with the hat. Instead of shoes with;long points and a leather apron,, he wore a blue,, double-breasted suit and;a black shift with a yellow tie. Instead of a crooked thorn stick,, he;carried a rolled copy of the Daily Running Horse.;;That's what I get for fooling with four-bit broads,, he said by way of;greeting.;;Tod nodded and tried to concentrate on the green hat. His ready;acquiescence seemed to irritate the little man.;;No quiff can give Abe Kusich the fingeroo and get away with it,, he said;bitterly. Not when I can get her leg broke for twenty bucks and I got;twenty.;;He took out a thick billfold and shook it at Tod.;;So she thinks she can give me the fingeroo,, hah? Well,, let me tell...;;Tod broke in hastily.;;You're right,, Mr. Kusich.;;The dwarf came over to where Tod was sitting and for a moment Tod thought;he was going to climb into his lap,, but he only asked his name and shook;hands. The little man had a powerful grip.;;Let me tell you something,, Hackett,, if you hadn't come along,, I'da broke;in the door. That dame thinks she can give me the fingeroo,, but she's got;another thinkola coming. But thanks anyway.;;Forget it;;I don't forget nothing. I remember. I remember those who do me dirt and;those who do me favors.;;He wrinkled his brow and was silent for a moment. Listen,, he finally;said,, seeing as you helped me,, I got to return it. I don't want anybody;going around saying Abe Kusich owes him anything. So I'll tell you what.;I'll give you a good one for the fifth at Caliente. You put a fiver on;its nose and it'll get you twenty smackeroos. What I'm telling you is;strictly correct.;;Tod didn't know how to answer and his hesitation offended the little man.;;Would I give you a bum steer? he demanded,, scowling. Would I?;;Tod walked toward the door to get rid of him.;;No,, he said.;;Then why won't you bet,, hah?;;What's the name of the horse? Tod asked,, hoping to calm him.;;The dwarf had followed him to the door,, pulling the bathrobe after him by;one sleeve. Hat and all,, he came to a foot below Tod's belt.;;Tragopan. He's a certain,, sure winner. I know the guy who owns him and;he gave me the office.;;Is he a Greek? Tod asked.;;He was being pleasant in order to hide the attempt he was making to;maneuver the dwarf through the door. Yeh,, he's a Greek. Do you know;him?;;No.;;No?;;No,, said Tod with finality.;;Keep your drawers on,, ordered the dwarf,, all I want to know is how you;know he's a Greek if you don't know him?;;His eyes narrowed with suspicion and he clenched his fists.;;Tod smiled to placate him.;;I just guessed it.;;You did?;;The dwarf hunched his shoulders as though he were going to pull a gun or;throw a punch. Tod backed off and tried to explain.;;I guessed he was a Greek because Tragopan is a Greek word that means;pheasant.;;The dwarf was far from satisfied.;;How do you know what it means? You ain't a Greek?;;No,, but I know a few Greek words.;;So you're a wise guy,, hah,, a know-it-all.;;He took a short step forward,, moving on his toes,, an Tod got set to block;a punch.;;A college man,, hah? Well,, let me tell...;;His foot caught in the wrapper and he fell forward on his hands. He;forgot Tod and cursed the bathrobe,, then got started on the woman again.;;So she thinks she can give me the fingeroo.;;He kept poking himself in the chest with his thumbs.;;Who gave her forty bucks for an abortion? Who? And another ten to go to;the country for a rest that time. To a ranch I sent her. And who got her;fiddle out of hock that time in Santa Monica? Who?;;That's right,, Tod said,, getting ready to give him a quick shove through;the door.;;But he didn't have to shove him. The little man suddenly darted out of;the room and ran down the hall,, dragging the bathrobe after him.;;A few days later,, Tod went into a stationary store on Vine Street to buy;a magazine. While he was looking through the rack,, he felt a tug at the;bottom of his jacket. It was Abe Kusich,, the dwarf,, again.;;How's things? he demanded.;;Tod was surprised to find that he was just as truculentas as he had he;had been the other night. Later,, when he got to know him better,, he;discovered that Abe's pugnacity was often a joke. When he used it on his;friends,, they played with him like one does with a growling puppy,,;staving off his mad rushes and then baiting him to rush again.;;Fair enough,, Tod said,, but I think I'll move.;;He had spent most of Sunday looking for a place to live and was full of;the subject. The moment he mentioned it,, however,, he knew that he had;made a mistake. He tried to end the matter by turning away,, but the;little man blocked him. He evidently considered himself an expert on the;housing situation. After naming and discarding a dozen possibilities;without a word from Tod,, he finally hit on the San Bernardino Arms.;;That's the place for you,, the San Berdoo. I live there,, so I ought to;know. The owner's strictly from hunger. Come on,, I'll get you fixed up;swell.;;I don't know,, I... Tod began.;;The dwarf bridled instantly,, and appeared to be mortally offended.;;I suppose it ain't good enough for you. Well,, let me tell you something,,;you...;;Tod allowed himself to be bullied and went with the dwarf to Pinyon;Canyon. The rooms in the San Berdoo were small and not very clean. He;rented one without hesitation,, however,, when he saw Faye Greener in the;hall.;;;3;;;Tod had fallen asleep. When he woke again,, it was after eight o'clock. He;took a bath and shaved,, then dressed in front of the bureau mirror. He;tried to watch his fingers as he fixed his collar and tie,, but his eyes;kept straying to the photograph that was pushed into the upper corner of;the frame.;;It was a picture of Faye Greener,, a still from a two-reel farce in which;she had worked as an extra. She had given him the photograph willingly;enough,, had even autographed it in a large,, wild hand,, Affectionately;yours,, Faye Greener,, but she refused his friendship,, or,, rather,,;insisted on keeping it impersonal. She had told him why. He had nothing;to offer her,, neither money nor looks,, and she could only love a handsome;man and would only let a wealthy man love her. Tod was a good-hearted;man,, and she liked good-hearted men,, but only as friends. She wasn't;hard-boiled. It was just that she put love on a special plane,, where a;man without money or looks couldn't move.;;Tod grunted with annoyance as he turned to the photograph. In it she was;wearing a harem costume,, full Turkish trousers,, breastplates and a monkey;jacket,, and lay stretched out on a silken divan. One hand held a beer;bottle and the other a pewter stein.;;He had gone all the way to Glendale to see her in that movie. It was;about an American drummer who gets lost in the seraglio of a Damascus;merchant and has a lot of fun with the female inmates. Faye played one of;the dancing girls. She had only one line to speak,, Oh,, Mr. Smith! and;spoke it badly.;;She was a tall girl with wide,, straight shoulders and long,, swordlike;legs. Her neck was long,, too,, and columnar. Her face was much fuller than;the rest of her body would lead you to expect and much larger. It was a;moon face,, wide at the cheek bones and narrow at chin and brow. She wore;her platinum hair long,, letting it fall almost to her shoulders in;back,, but kept it away from her face and ears with a narrow blue ribbon;that went under it and was tied on top of her head with a little bow.;;She was supposed to look drunk and she did,, but not with alcohol. She lay;stretched out on the divan with her arms and legs spread,, as though;welcoming a lover,, and her lips were parted in a heavy,, sullen smile. She;was supposed to look inviting,, but the invitation wasn't to pleasure.;;Tod lit a cigarette and inhaled with a nervous gasp. He started to fool;with his tie again,, but had to go back to the photograph.;;Her invitation wasn't to pleasure,, but to struggle,, hard and sharp,,;closer to murder than to love. If you threw yourself on her,, it would be;like throwing yourself from the parapet of a skyscraper. You would do it;with a scream. You couldn't expect to rise again. Your teeth would be;driven into your skull like nails into a pine board and your back would;be broken. You wouldn't even have time to sweat or close your eyes.;;He managed to laugh at his language,, but it wasn't a real laugh and;nothing was destroyed by it.;;If she would only let him,, he would be glad to throw himself,, no matter;what the cost. But she wouldn't have him. She didn't love him and he;couldn't further her career. She wasn't sentimental and she had no need;for tenderness,, even if he were capable of it.;;When he had finished dressing,, he hurried out of the room. He had;promised to go to a party at Claude Estee's.;;;4;;;Claude was a successful screen writer who lived in a big house that was;an exact reproduction of the old Dupuy mansion near Biloxi,, Mississippi.;When Tod came up the walk between the boxwood hedges,, he greeted him from;the enormous,, two-story porch by doing the impersonation that went with;the Southern colonial architecture. He teetered back and forth on his;heels like a Civil War colonel and made believe he had a large belly.;;He had no belly at all. He was a dried-up little man with the rubbed;features and stooped shoulders of a postal clerk. The shiny mohair coat;and nondescript trousers of that official would have become him,, but he;was dressed,, as always,, elaborately. In the buttonhole of his brown;jacket was a lemon flower. His trousers were of reddish Harris tweed with;a hound tooth check and on his feet were a pair of magnificent,,;rust-colored bluchers. His shirt was ivory flannel and his knitted tie a;red that was almost black.;;While Tod mounted the steps to reach his outstretched hand,, he shouted to;the butler.;;Here,, you black rascal! A mint julep.;;A Chinese servant came running with a Scotch and soda.;;After talking to Tod for a moment,, Claude started him in the direction of;Alice,, his wife,, who was at the other end of the porch.;;Don't run off,, he whispered. We're going to a sporting house.;;Alice was sitting in a wicker swing with a woman named Mrs. Joan;Schwartzen. When she asked him if he was playing any tennis,, Mrs.;Schwartzen interrupted her.;;How silly,, batting an inoffensive ball across something that ought to be;used to catch fish on account of millions are starving for a bite of;herring.;;Joan's a female tennis champ,, Alice explained.;;Mrs. Schwartzen was a big girl with large hands and feet and square,, bony;shoulders. She had A pretty,, eighteen-year-old face and a;thirty-five-year-old neck that was veined and sinewy. Her deep sunburn,,;ruby colored with a slight blue tint,, kept the contrast between her face;and neck from being too startling.;;Well,, I wish we were going to a brothel this minute,, she said. I adore;them.;;She turned to Tod and fluttered her eyelids.;;Don't you,, Mr. Hackett?;;That's right,, Joan darling,, Alice answered for him. Nothing like a;bagnio to set a fellow up. Hair of the dog that bit you.;;How dare you insult me!;;She stood up and took Tod's arm.;;Convoy me over there.;;She pointed to the group of men with whom Claude was standing.;;For God's sake,, convoy her,, Alice said. She thinks they're telling;dirty stories.;;Mrs. Schwartzen pushed right among them,, dragging Tod after her.;;Are you talking smut? she asked. I adore smut. They all laughed;politely.;;No,, shop,, said someone.;;I don't believe it. I can tell from the beast in your voices. Go ahead,,;do say something obscene.;;This time no one laughed.;;Tod tried to disengage her arm,, but she kept a firm grip on it. There was;a moment of awkward silence,, then the man she had interrupted tried to;make a fresh start.;;The picture business is too humble,, he said. We ought to resent people;like Coombes.;;That's right,, said another man. Guys like that come out here,, make a;lot of money,, grouse all the time about the place,, flop on their;assignments,, then go back East and tell dialect stories about producers;they've never met.;;My God,, Mrs. Schwartzen said to Tod in a loud,, stagey whisper,, they;are talking shop.;;Let's look for the man with the drinks,, Tod said.;;No. Take me into the garden. Have you seen what's in the swimming pool?;;She pulled him along.;;The air of the garden was heavy with the odor of mimosa and honeysuckle.;Through a slit in the blue serge sky poked a grained moon that looked;like an enormous bone button. A little flagstone path,, made narrow by its;border of oleander,, led to the edge of the sunken pool. On the bottom,,;near the deep end,, he could see a heavy,, black mass of some kind.;;What is it? he asked.;;She kicked a switch that was hidden at the base of a shrub and a row of;submerged floodlights illuminated the green water. The thing was a dead;horse,, or,, rather,, a life-size,, realistic reproduction of one. Its legs;stuck up stiff and straight and it had an enormous,, distended belly. Its;hammerhead lay twisted to one side and from its mouth,, which was set in;an agonized grin,, hung a heavy,, black tongue.;;Isn't it marvelous! exclaimed Mrs. Schwartzen,, clapping her hands and;jumping up and down excitedly like a little girl.;;What's it made of?;;Then you weren't fooled? How impolite! It's rubber,, of course. It cost;lots of money.;;But why?;;'To amuse. We were looking at the pool one day and somebody,, Jerry;Appis,, I think,, said that it needed a dead horse on the bottom,, so Alice;got one. Don't you think it looks cute?;;Very.;;You're just an old meanie. Think how happy the Estees must feel,, showing;it to people and listening to their merriment and their oh's and ah's of;unconfined delight.;;She stood on the edge of the pool and ohed and ahed rapidly several;times in succession.;;Is it still there? someone called.;;Tod turned and saw two women and a man coming down the path.;;I think its belly's going to burst,, Mrs. Schwartzen shouted to them;gleefully.;;Goody,, said the man,, hurrying to look.;;But it's only full of air,, said one of the women.;;Mrs. Schwartzen made believe she was going to cry. You're just like that;mean Mr. Hackett. You just won't let me cherish my illusions.;;Tod was halfway to the house when she called after him. He waved but kept;going.;;The men with Claude were still talking shop.;;But how are you going to get rid of the illiterate mockies that run it?;They've got a strangle hold on the industry. Maybe they're intellectual;stumblebums,, but they're damn good businessmen. Or at least they know how;to go into receivership and come up with a gold watch in their teeth.;;They ought to put some of the millions they make back into the business;again. Like Rockefeller does with his Foundation. People used to hate the;Rockefellers,, but now instead of hollering about their ill-gotten oil;dough,, everybody praises them for what the Foundation does. It's a swell;stunt and pictures could do the same thing. Have a Cinema Foundation and;make contributions to Science and Art. You know,, give the racket a;front.;;Tod took Claude to one side to say good night,, but he wouldn't let him;go. He led him into the library and mixed two double Scotches. They sat;down on the couch facing the fireplace.;;You haven't been to Audrey Jenning's place? Claude asked.;;No,, but I've heard tell of it.;;Then you've got to come along.;;I don't like pro-sport.;;We won't indulge in any. We're just going to see a movie.;;I get depressed.;;Not at Jenning's you won't. She makes vice attractive by skillful;packaging. Her dive's a triumph of industrial design.;;Tod liked to hear him talk. He was master of an involved comic rhetoric;that permitted him to express his moral indignation and still keep his;reputation for worldliness and wit.;;Tod fed him another lead. I don't care how much cellophane she wraps it;in,, he said--nautch joints are depressing,, like all places for deposit,,;banks,, mail boxes,, tombs,, vending machines.;;Love is like a vending machine,, eh? Not bad. You insert a coin and press;home the lever. There's some mechanical activity inside the bowels of the;device. You receive a small sweet,, frown at yourself in the dirty mirror,,;adjust your hat,, take a firm grip on your umbrella and walk away,, trying;to look as though nothing had happened. It's good,, but it's not for;pictures.;;Tod played straight again.;;That's not it. I've been chasing a girl and it's like carrying something;a little too large to conceal in your pocket,, like a briefcase or a small;valise. It's uncomfortable.;;I know,, I know. It's always uncomfortable. First your right hand gets;tired,, then your left. You put the valise down and sit on it,, but people;are surprised and stop to stare at you,, so you move on. You hide it;behind a tree and hurry away,, but someone finds it and runs after you to;return it. It's a small valise when you leave home in the morning,, cheap;and with a bad handle,, but by evening it's a trunk with brass corners and;many foreign labels. I know. It's good,, but it won't film. You've got to;remember your audience. What about the barber in Purdue? He's been;cutting hair all day and he's tired. He doesn't want to see some dope;carrying a valise or fooling with a nickel machine. What the barber wants;is amour and glamor.;;The last part was for himself and he sighed heavily. He was about to;begin again when the Chinese servant came in and said that the others;were ready to leave for Mrs. Jenning's.;;;5;;;They started out in several cars. Tod rode in the front of the one Claude;drove and as they went down Sunset Boulevard he described Mrs. Jenning;for him. She had been a fairly prominent actress in the days of silent;films,, but sound made it impossible for her to get work. Instead of;becoming an extra or a bit player like many other old stars,, she had;shown excellent business sense and had opened a callhouse. She wasn't;vicious. Far from it. She ran her business just as other women run;lending libraries,, shrewdly and with taste.;;None of the girls lived on the premises. You telephoned and she sent a;girl over. The charge was thirty dollars for a single night of sport and;Mrs. Jenning kept fifteen of it. Some people might think that fifty per;cent is a high brokerage fee,, but she really earned every cent of it.;There was a big overhead. She maintained a beautiful house for the girls;to wait in and a car and a chauffeur to deliver them to the clients.;;Then,, too,, she had to move in the kind of society where she could make;the right contacts. After all,, not every man can afford thirty dollars.;She permitted her girls to service only men of wealth and position,, not;to say taste and discretion. She was so particular that she insisted on;meeting the prospective sportsman before servicing him. She had often;said,, and truthfully,, that she would not let a girl of hers go to a man;with whom she herself would not be willing to sleep.;;And she was really cultured. All the most distinguished visitors;considered it quite a lark to meet her. They were disappointed,, however,,;when they discovered how refined she was. They wanted to talk about;certain lively matters of universal interest,, but she insisted on;discussing Gertrude Stein and Juan Gris. No matter how hard the;distinguished visitor tried,, and some had been known to go to really;great lengths,, he could never find a flaw in her refinement or make a;breach in her culture.;;Claude was still using his peculiar rhetoric on Mrs. Jenning when she;came to the door of her house to greet them.;;It's so nice to see you again,, she said. I was telling Mrs. Prince at;tea only yesterday--the Estees are my favorite couple.;;She was a handsome woman,, smooth and buttery,, with fair hair and a red;complexion.;;She led them into a small drawing room whose color scheme was violet,,;gray and rose. The Venetian blinds were rose,, as was the ceiling,, and the;walls were covered with a pale gray paper that had a tiny,, widely spaced;flower design in violet. On one wall hung a silver screen,, the kind that;rolls up,, and against the opposite wall,, on each side of a cherrywood;table,, was a row of chairs covered with rose and gray,, glazed chintz;bound in violet piping. There was a small projection machine on the table;and a young man in evening dress was fumbling with it.;;She waved them to their seats. A waiter then came in and asked what they;wanted to drink. When their orders had been taken and filled,, she flipped;the light switch and the young man started his machine. It whirred;merrily,, but he had trouble in getting it focused.;;What are we going to see first? Mrs. Schwartzen asked. Le Predicament;de Marie.;;That sounds ducky.;;It's charming,, utterly charming,, said Mrs. Jenning. Yes,, said the;cameraman,, who was still having trouble. I love Le Predicament de Marie.;It has a marvelous quality that is too exciting.;;There was a long delay,, during which he fussed desperately with his;machine. Mrs. Schwartzen started to whistle and stamp her feet and the;others joined in. They imitated a rowdy audience in the days of the;nickelodeon.;;Get a move on,, slow poke.;;What's your hurry? Here's your hat.;;Get a horse!;;Get out and get under!;;The young man finally found the screen with his light beam and the film;began.;;LE PREDICAMENT DE MARIE;ou;LA BONNE DISTRAITE;;Marie,, the bonne,, was a buxom young girl in a tight-fitting black silk;uniform with very short skirts. On her head was a tiny lace cap. In the;first scene,, she was shown serving dinner to a middle-class family in an;oak-paneled dining room full of heavy,, carved furniture. The family was;very respectable and consisted of a bearded,, frock-coated father,, a;mother with a whalebone collar and a cameo brooch,, a tall,, thin son with;a long mustache and almost no chin and a little girl wearing a large bow;in her hair and a crucifix on a gold chain around her neck.;;After some low comedy with father's beard and the soup,, the actors;settled down seriously to their theme. It was evident that while the;whole family desired Marie,, she only desired the young girl. Using his;napkin to hide his activities,, the old man pinched Marie,, the son tried;to look down the neck of her dress and the mother patted her knee. Marie,,;for her part,, surreptitiously fondled the child.;;The scene changed to Marie's room. She undressed and got into a chiffon;negligee,, leaving on only her black silk stockings and high-heeled shoes.;She was making an elaborate night toilet when the child entered. Marie;took her on her lap and started to kiss her. There was a knock on the;door. Consternation. She hid the child in the closet and let in the;bearded father. He was suspicious and she had to accept his advances. He;was embracing her when there was another knock. Again consternation and;tableau. This time it was the mustachioed son. Marie hid the father under;the bed. No sooner had the son begun to grow warm than there was another;knock. Marie made him climb into a large blanket chest. The new caller;was the lady of the house. She,, too,, was just settling down to work when;there was another knock.;;Who could it be? A telegram? A policeman? Frantically Marie counted the;different hiding places. The whole family was present. She tiptoed to the;door and listened.;;Who can it be that wishes to enter now? read the title card.;;And there the machine stuck. The young man in evening dress became as;frantic as Marie. When lie got it running again,, there was a flash of;light and the film whizzed through the apparatus until it had all run;out. I'm sorry,, extremely,, he said. I'll have to rewind.;;It's a frameup,, someone yelled. Fake!;;Cheat!;;The old teaser routine!;;They stamped their feet and whistled.;;Under cover of the mock riot,, Tod sneaked out. He wanted to get some;fresh air. The waiter,, whom he found loitering in the hall,, showed him to;the patio in back of the house.;;On his return,, he peeked into the different rooms. In one of them he;found a large number of miniature dogs in a curio cabinet. There were;glass pointers,, silver beagles,, porcelain schnauzers,, stone dachshunds,,;aluminum bulldogs,, onyx whippets,, china bassets,, wooden spaniels. Every;recognized breed was represented and almost every material that could be;sculptured,, cast or carved.;;While he was admiring the little figures,, he heard a girl singing. He;thought he recognized her voice and peeked into the hall. It was Mary;Dove,, one of Faye Greener's best friends.;;Perhaps Faye also worked for Mrs. Jenning. If so,, for thirty dollars...;;He went back to see the rest of the film.;;;6;;;Tod's hope that he could end his trouble by paying a small fee didn't;last long. When he got Claude to ask Mrs. Jenning about Faye,, that lady;said she had never heard of the girl. Claude then asked her to inquire;through Mary Dove. A few days later she phoned him to say there was;nothing doing. The girl wasn't available.;;Tod wasn't really disappointed. He didn't want Faye that way,, not at;least while he still had a. chance some other way. Lately,, he had begun;to think he had a good one. Harry,, her father,, was sick and that gave him;an excuse for hanging around their apartment. He ran errands and kept the;old man company. To repay his kindness,, she permitted him the intimacies;of a family friend. He hoped to deepen her gratitude and make it serious.;;Apart from this purpose,, he was interested in Harry and enjoyed visiting;him. The old man was a clown and Tod had all the painter's usual love of;clowns. But what was more important,, he felt that his clownship was a;clue to the people who stared (a painter's clue,, that is--a clue in the;form of a symbol),, just as Faye's dreams were another.;;He sat near Harry's bed and listened to his stories by the hour. Forty;years in vaudeville and burlesque had provided him with an infinite;number of them. As he put it,, his life had consisted of a;lightning series of nip-ups,, high-gruesomes,, flying-Ws and;hundred-and-eights done to escape a barrage of exploding stoves. An;exploding stove was any catastrophe,, natural or human,, from a flood in;Medicine Hat,, Wyoming,, to an angry policeman in Moose Factory,, Ontario.;;When Harry had first begun his stage career,, he had probably restricted;his clowning to the boards,, but now he clowned continuously. It was his;sole method of defense. Most people,, he had discovered,, won't go out of;their way to punish a clown.;;He used a set of elegant gestures to accent the comedy of his bent,,;hopeless figure and wore a special costume,, dressing like a banker,, a;cheap,, unconvincing,, imitation banker. The costume consisted of a greasy;derby with an unusually high crown,, a wing collar and polka dot;four-in-hand,, a shiny double-breasted jacket and gray-striped trousers.;His outfit fooled no one,, but then he didn't intend it to fool anyone.;His slyness was of a different sort.;;On the stage he was a complete failure and knew it. Yet he claimed to;have once come very close to success. To prove how close,, he made Tod;read an old clipping from the theatrical section of the Sunday Times.;;BEDRAGGLED HARLEQUIN,, it was headed.;;The commedia del arte is not dead,, but lives on in Brooklyn,, or was;living there last week on the stage of the Oglethorpe Theatre in the;person of one Harry Greener. Mr. Greener is of a troupe called 'The;Flying Lings,,' who,, by the time this reaches you,, have probably moved on;to Mystic,, Connecticut,, or some other place more fitting than the borough;of large families. If you have the time and really love the theatre,, by;all means seek out the Lings wherever they may be.;;Mr. Greener,, the bedraggled Harlequin of our caption,, is not bedraggled;but clean,, neat and sweet when he first comes on. By the time the Lings,,;four muscular Orientals,, finish with him,, however,, he is plenty;bedraggled. He is tattered and bloody,, but still sweet.;;When Mr. Greener enters the trumpets are properly silent. Mama Ling is;spinning a plate on the end of a stick held in her mouth,, Papa Ling is;doing cartwheels,, Sister Ling is juggling fans and Sonny Ling is hanging;from the proscenium arch by his pigtail. As he inspects his strenuous;colleagues,, Mr. Greener tries to hide his confusion under some much too;obvious worldliness. He ventures to tickle Sister and receives a powerful;kick in the belly in return for this innocent attention. Having been;kicked,, he is on familiar ground and begins to tell a dull joke. Father;Ling sneaks up behind him and tosses him to Brother,, who looks the other;way. Mr. Greener lands on the back of his neck. He shows his mettle by;finishing his dull story from a recumbent position. When he stands up,,;the audience,, which failed to laugh at his joke,, laughs at his limp,, so;he continues lame for the rest of the act.;;Mr. Greener begins another story,, even longer and duller than his first.;Just before he arrives at the gag line,, the orchestra blares loudly and;drowns him out. He is very patient and very brave. He begins again,, but;the orchestra will not let him finish. The pain that almost,, not quite,,;thank God,, crumples his stiff little figure would be unbearable if it;were not obviously make-believe. It is gloriously funny.;;The finale is superb. While the Ling Family flies through the air,, Mr.;Greener,, held to the ground by his sense of reality and his knowledge of;gravitation,, tries hard to make the audience think that he is neither;surprised nor worried by the rocketing Orientals. It's familiar stuff,,;his hands signal,, but his face denies this. As time goes on and no one is;hurt,, he regains his assurance. The acrobats ignore him,, so he ignores;the acrobats. His is the final victory,; the applause is for him.;;My first thought was that some producer should put Mr. Greener into a;big revue against a background of beautiful girls and glittering;curtains. But my second was that this would be a mistake. I am afraid;that Mr. Greener,, like certain humble field plants which die when;transferred to richer soil,, had better be left to bloom in vaudeville;against a background of ventriloquists and lady bicycle riders.;;Harry had more than a dozen copies of this article,, several on rag paper.;After trying to get a job by inserting a small advertisement in Variety;(...'some producer should put Mr. Greener into a big revue...' The;Times),, he had come to Hollywood,, thinking to earn a living playing;comedy bits in films. There proved to be little demand for his talents,,;however. As he himself put it,, he stank from hunger. To supplement his;meager income from the studios,, he peddled silver polish which he made in;the bathroom of the apartment out of chalk,, soap and yellow axle grease.;When Faye wasn't at Central Casting,, she took him around on his peddling;trips in her Model T Ford. It was on their last expedition together that;he had fallen sick.;;It was on this trip that Faye acquired a new suitor by the name of Homer;Simpson. About a week after Harry had taken to his bed,, Tod met Homer for;the first time. He was keeping the old man company when their;conversation was interrupted by a light knock on the apartment door. Tod;answered it and found a man standing in the hall with flowers for Faye;and a bottle of port wine for her father.;;Tod examined him eagerly. He didn't mean to be rude but at first glance;this man seemed an exact model for the kind of person who comes to;California to die,, perfect in every detail down to fever eyes and unruly;hands.;;My name is Homer Simpson,, the man gasped,, then shifted uneasily and;patted his perfectly dry forehead with a folded handkerchief.;;Won't you come in? Tod asked.;;He shook his head heavily and thrust the wine and flowers at Tod. Before;Tod could say anything,, he had lumbered off.;;Tod saw that he was mistaken. Homer Simpson was only physically the type.;The men he meant were not shy.;;He took the gifts in to Harry,, who didn't seem at all surprised. He said;Homer was one of his grateful customers.;;That Miracle Polish of mine sure does fetch 'em.;;Later,, when Faye came home and heard the story,, she was very much amused.;They both told Tod how they had happened to meet Homer,, interrupting;themselves and each other every few seconds to laugh.;;The next thing Tod saw Homer staring at the apartment house from the;shadow of a date palm on the opposite side of the street. He watched him;for a few minutes,, then called out a friendly greeting. Without replying,,;Homer ran away. On the next day and the one after,, Tod again saw him;lurking near the palm tree. He finally caught him by approaching the tree;silently from the rear.;;Hello,, Mr. Simpson,, Tod said softly. The Creeners were very grateful;for your gift.;;This time Simpson didn't move,, perhaps because Tod had him backed against;the tree.;;That's fine,, he blurted out. I was passing...I live up the street.;;Tod managed to keep their conversation going for several minutes before;he escaped again.;;The next time Tod was able to approach him without the stalk. From then;on,, he responded very quickly to his advances. Sympathy,, even of the most;obvious sort,, made him articulate,, almost garrulous.;;;7;;;Tod was right about one thing at least. Like most of the people he was;interested in,, Homer was a Middle-Westerner. He came from a little town;near Des Moines,, Iowa,, called Wayneville,, where he had worked for twenty;years in a hotel.;;One day,, while sitting in the park in the rain,, he had caught cold and;his cold developed into pneumonia. When he came out of the hospital,, he;found that the hotel had hired a new bookkeeper. They offered to take him;on again,, but his doctor advised him to go to California for a rest. The;doctor had an authoritative manner,, so Homer left Wayneville for the;Coast.;;After living for a week in a railroad hotel in Los Angeles,, he rented a;cottage in Pinyon Canyon. It was only the second house the real estate;agent showed him,, but he took it because he was tired and because the;agent was a bully.;;He rather liked the way the cottage was located. It was the last house in;the canyon and the hills rose directly behind the garage. They were;covered with lupines,, Canterbury bells,, poppies,, and several varieties of;large yellow daisy. There were also some scrub pines,, Joshua and;eucalyptus trees. The agent told him that he would see doves and plumed;quail,, but during all the time he lived there,, he saw only a few large,,;black velvet spiders and a lizard. He grew very fond of the lizard.;;The house was cheap because it was hard to rent. Most of the people who;took cottages in that neighborhood wanted them to be Spanish and this;one,, so the agent claimed,, was Irish. Homer thought that the place;looked kind of queer,, but the agent insisted that it was cute.;;The house was queer. It had an enormous and very crooked stone chimney,,;little dormer windows with big hoods and a thatched roof that came down;very low on both sides of the front door. This door was of gumwood;painted like fumed oak and it hung on enormous hinges. Although made by;machine,, the hinges had been carefully stamped to appear hand-forged. The;same kind of care and skill had been used to make the roof thatching,,;which was not really straw but heavy fireproof paper colored and ribbed;to look like straw.;;The prevailing taste had been followed in the living room. It was;Spanish. The walls were pale orange flecked with pink and on them hung;several silk armorial banners in red and gold. A big galleon stood on the;mantelpiece. Its hull was plaster,, its sails paper and its rigging wire.;In the fireplace was a variety of cactus in gaily colored Mexican pots.;Some of the plants were made of rubber and cork,; others were real.;;The room was lit by wall fixtures in the shape of galleons with pointed;amber bulbs projecting from their decks. The table held a lamp with a;paper shade,, oiled to look like parchment,, that had several more galleons;painted on it. On each side of the windows red velvet draperies hung from;black,, double-headed spears.;;The furniture consisted of a heavy couch that had fat monks for legs and;was covered with faded red damask,, and three swollen armchairs,, also red.;In the center of the room was a very long mahogany table. It was of the;trestle type and studded with large-headed bronze nails. Beside each of;the chairs was a small end table,, the same color and design as the big;one,, but with a colored tile let into the top.;;In the two small bedrooms still another style had been used. This the;agent had called New England. There was a spool bed made of iron;grained like wood,, a Windsor chair of the kind frequently seen in tea;shops,, and a Governor Winthrop dresser painted to look like unpainted;pine. On the floor was a small hooked rug. On the wall facing the dresser;was a colored etching of a snowbound Connecticut farmhouse,, complete with;wolf. Both of these rooms were exactly alike in every detail. Even the;pictures were duplicates.;;There was also a bathroom and a kitchen.;;;8;;;It took Homer only a few minutes to get settled in his new home. He;unpacked his trunk,, hung his two suits,, both dark gray,, in the closet of;one of his bedrooms and put his shirts and underclothes into the dresser;drawers. He made no attempt to rearrange the furniture.;;After an aimless tour of the house and the yard,, he sat down on the couch;in the living room. He sat as though wailing for someone in the lobby of;a hotel. He remained that way for almost half an hour without moving;anything but his hands,, then got up and went into the bedroom and sat;down on the edge of the bed.;;Although it was still early in the afternoon,, he felt very sleepy. He was;afraid to stretch out and go to sleep. Not because he had bad dreams,, but;because it was so hard for him to wake again. When he fell asleep,, he was;always afraid that he would never get up.;;But his fear wasn't as strong as his need. He got his alarm clock and set;it for seven o'clock,, then lay down with it next to his ear. Two hours;later,, it seemed like seconds to him,, the alarm went off. The bell rang;for a full minute before he began to work laboriously toward;consciousness. The struggle was a hard one. He groaned. His head trembled;and his feet shot out. Finally his eyes opened,, then widened. Once more;the victory was his.;;He lay stretched out on the bed,, collecting his senses and testing the;different parts of his body. Every part was awake but his hands. They;still slept. He was not surprised. They demanded special attention,, had;always demanded it. When he had been a child,, he used to stick pins into;them and once had even thrust them into a fire. Now he used only cold;water.;;He got out of bed in sections,, like a poorly made automaton,, and carried;his hands into the bathroom. He turned on the cold water. When the basin;was full,, he plunged his hands in up to the wrists. They lay quietly on;the bottom like a pair of strange aquatic animals. When they were;thoroughly chilled and began to crawl about,, he lifted them out and hid;them in a towel.;;He was cold. He ran hot water into the tub and began to undress,, fumbling;with the buttons of his clothing as though he were undressing a stranger.;He was naked before the tub was full enough to get in and he sat down on;a stool to wait. He kept his enormous hands folded quietly on his belly.;Although absolutely still,, they seemed curbed rather than resting.;;Except for his hands,, which belonged on a piece of monumental sculpture,,;and his small head,, he was well proportioned. His muscles were large and;round and he had a full,, heavy chest. Yet there was something wrong. For;all his size and shape,, he looked neither strong nor fertile. He was like;one of Picasso's great sterile athletes,, who brood hopelessly on pink;sand,, staring at veined marble waves.;;When the tub was full,, he got in and sank down in the hot water. He;grunted his comfort. But in another moment he would begin to remember,, in;just another moment. He tried to fool his memory by overwhelming it with;tears and brought up the sobs that were always lurking uneasily in his;chest. He cried softly at first,, then harder. The sound he made was like;that of a dog lapping gruel. He concentrated on how miserable and lonely;he was,, but it didn't work. The thing he was trying so desperately to;avoid kept crowding into his mind.;;One day when he was working in the hotel,, a guest called Romola Martin;had spoken to him in the elevator.;;Mr. Simpson,, you're Mr. Simpson,, the bookkeeper?;;Yes.;;I'm in six-eleven.;;She was small and childlike,, with a quick,, nervous manner. In her arms;she coddled a package which obviously contained a square gin bottle.;;Yes,, said Homer again,, working against his natural instinct to be;friendly. He knew that Miss Martin owed several weeks' rent and had heard;the room clerk say she was a drunkard.;;Oh!... the girl went on coquettishly,, making obvious their difference;in size,, I'm sorry you're worried about your bill,, I...;;The intimacy of her tone embarrassed Homer.;;You'll have to speak to the manager,, he rapped out,, turning away.;;He was trembling when he reached his office.;;How bold the creature was! She was drunk,, of course,, but not so drunk;that she didn't know what she was doing. He hurriedly labeled his;excitement disgust.;;Soon afterwards the manager called and asked him to bring in Miss;Martin's credit card. When he went into the manager's office,, he found;Miss Carlisle,, the room clerk there. Homer listened to what the manager;was saying to her.;;You roomed six-eleven?;;I did,, yes,, sir.;;Why? She's obvious enough,, isn't she?;;Not when she's sober.;;Never mind that. We don't want her kind in this hotel.;;I'm sorry.;;The manager turned to Homer and took the credit card he was holding.;;She owes thirty-one dollars,, Homer said.;;She'll have to pay up and get out. I don't want her kind around here.;He smiled. Especially when they run up bills. Get her on the phone for;me.;;Homer asked the telephone operator for six-eleven and after a short time;was told that the room didn't answer. She's in the house,, he said. I;saw her in the elevator.;;I'll have the housekeeper look.;;Homer was working on his books some minutes later when his phone rang. It;was the manager again. He said that six-eleven had been reported in by;the housekeeper and asked Homer to take her a bill.;;Tell her to pay up or get out,, he said.;;His first thought was to ask that Miss Carlisle be sent because he was;busy,, but he didn't dare to suggest it. While making out the bill,, he;began to realize how excited he was. It was terrifying. Little waves of;sensation moved along his nerves and the base of his tongue tingled.;;When he got off at the sixth floor,, he felt almost gay.;;His step was buoyant and he had completely forgotten his troublesome;hands. He stopped at six-eleven and made as though to knock,, then;suddenly took fright and lowered his-fist without touching the door.;;He couldn't go through with it. They would have to send Miss Carlisle.;;The housekeeper,, who had been watching from the end of the hall,, came up;before he could escape.;;She doesn't answer,, Homer said hurriedly.;;Did you knock hard enough? That slut is in there. Before Homer could;reply,, she pounded on the door. Open up! she shouted.;;Homer heard someone move inside,, then the door opened a few inches.;;Who is it,, please? a light voice asked.;;Mr. Simpson,, the bookkeeper,, he gasped.;;Come in,, please.;;The door opened a little wider and Homer went in without daring to look;around at the housekeeper. He stumbled to the center of the room and;stopped. Al first he was conscious only of the heavy odor of alcohol and;stale tobacco,, but then underneath he smelled a metallic perfume. His;eyes moved in a slow circle. On the floor was a litter of clothing,,;newspapers,, magazines,, and bottles. Miss Martin was huddled up on a;corner of the bed. She was wearing a man's black silk dressing gown with;light blue cuffs and lapel facings. Her close-cropped hair was the color;and texture of straw and she looked like a little boy. Her youthfulness;was heightened by her blue button eyes,, pink button nose and red button;mouth.;;Homer was too busy with his growing excitement to speak or even think. He;closed his eyes to tend it better,, nursing carefully what he felt. He had;to be careful,, for if he went too fast,, it might wither and then he would;be cold again. It continued to grow.;;Go away,, please,, I'm drunk,, Miss Martin said.;;Homer neither moved nor spoke.;;She suddenly began to sob. The coarse,, broken sounds she made seemed to;come from her stomach. She buried her face in her hands and pounded the;floor with her feet.;;Homer's feelings were so intense that his head bobbed stiffly on his neck;like that of a toy Chinese dragon.;;I'm broke. I haven't any money. I haven't a dime. I'm broke,, I tell;you.;;Homer pulled out his wallet and moved on the girl as though to strike her;with it.;;She cowered away from him and her sobs grew stronger.;;He dropped the wallet in her lap and stood over her,, not knowing what;else to do. When she saw the wallet,, she smiled,, but continued sobbing.;;Sit down,, she said.;;He sat down on the bed beside her.;;You strange man,, she said coyly. I could kiss you for being so nice.;;He caught her in his arms and hugged her. His suddenness frightened her;and she tried to pull away,, but he held on and began awkwardly to caress;her. He was completely unconscious of what he was doing. He knew only;that what he felt was marvelously sweet and that he had to make the;sweetness carry through to the poor,, sobbing woman.;;Miss Martin's sobs grew less and soon stopped altogether. He could feel;her fidget and gather Strength. The telephone rang.;;Don't answer it,, she said,, beginning to sob once more. He pushed her;away gently and stumbled to the telephone. It was Miss Carlisle.;;Are you all right? she asked,, or shall we send for the cops?;;All right,, he said,, hanging up.;;It was all over. He couldn't go back to the bed.;;Miss Martin laughed at his look of acute distress.;;Bring the gin,, you enormous cow,, she shouted gaily. It's under the;table.;;He saw her stretch herself out in a way that couldn't be mistaken. He ran;out of the room.;;Now in California,, he was crying because he had never seen Miss Martin;again. The next day the manager had told him that he had done a good job;and that she had paid up and checked out.;;Homer tried to find her. There were two other hotels in Wayneville,, small;run-down houses,, and he inquired at both of them. He also asked in the;few rooming places,, but with no success. She had left town.;;He settled back into his regular routine,, working ten hours,, eating two,,;sleeping the rest. Then he caught cold and had been advised to come to;California. He could easily afford not to work for a while. His father;had left him about six thousand dollars and during the twenty years he;had kept books in the hotel,, he had saved at least ten more.;;;9;;;He got out of the tub,, dried himself hurriedly with a rough towel,, then;went into the bedroom to dress. He felt even more stupid and washed out;than usual. It was always like that. His emotions surged up in an;enormous wave,, curving and rearing,, higher and higher,, until it seemed as;though the wave must carry everything before it. But the crash never;came. Something always happened at the very top of the crest and the wave;collapsed to run back like water down a drain,, leaving,, at the most,, only;the refuse of feeling.;;It took him a long time to get all his clothing on. He stopped to rest;after each garment with a desperation far out of proportion to the effort;involved.;;There was nothing to eat in the house and he had to go down to Hollywood;Boulevard for food. He thought of waiting until morning,, but then,,;although he was not hungry,, decided against waiting. It was only eight;o'clock and the trip would kill some time. If he just sat around,, the;temptation to go to sleep again would become irresistible.;;The night was warm and very still. He started down hill,, walking on the;outer edge of the pavement. He hurried between lamp-posts,, where the;shadows were heaviest,, and came to a full stop for a moment at every;circle of light. By the time he reached the boulevard,, he was fighting;the desire to run. He stopped for several minutes on the corner to get;his bearings. As he stood there,, poised for flight,, his fear made him;seem almost graceful.;;When several other people passed without paying any attention to him,, he;quieted down. He adjusted the collar of his coat and prepared to cross;the street. Before he could take two steps someone called to him.;;Hey,, you,, mister.;;It was a beggar who had spotted him from the shadow of a doorway. With;the infallible instinct of his kind,, he knew that Homer would be easy.;;Can you spare a nickel?;;No,, Homer said without conviction.;;The beggar laughed and repeated his question,, threateningly.;;A nickel,, mister!;;He poked his hand into Homer's face.;;Homer fumbled in his change pocket and dropped several coins on the;sidewalk. While the man scrambled for them,, he made his escape across the;street.;;The SunGold Market into which he turned was a large,, brilliantly lit;place. All the fixtures were chromium and the floors and walls were lined;with white tile. Colored spotlights played on the showcases and counters,,;heightening the natural hues of the different foods. The oranges were;bathed in red,, the lemons in yellow,, the fish in pale green,, the steaks;in rose and the eggs in ivory.;;Homer went directly to the canned goods department and bought a can of;mushroom soup and another of sardines. These and a half a pound of soda;crackers would be enough for his supper.;;Out on the street again with his parcel,, he started to walk home. When he;reached the corner that led to Pinyon Canyon and saw how steep and black;the hill looked,, he turned back along the lighted boulevard. He thought;of waiting until someone else started up the hill,, but finally took a;taxicab.;;;10;;;Although Homer had nothing to do but prepare his scanty meals,, he was not;bored. Except for the Romola Martin incident and perhaps one or two other;widely spaced events,, the forty years of his life had been entirely;without variety or excitement. As a bookkeeper,, he had worked;mechanically,, totaling figures and making entries with the same;impersonal detachment that he now opened cans of soup and made his bed.;;Someone watching him go about his little cottage might have thought him;sleep-walking or partially blind. His hands seemed to have a life and a;will of their own. It was they who pulled the sheets tight and shaped the;pillows.;;One day,, while opening a can of salmon for lunch,, his thumb received a;nasty cut. Although the wound must have hurt,, the calm,, slightly;querulous expression he usually wore did not change. The wounded hand;writhed about on the kitchen table until it was carried to the sink by;its mate and bathed tenderly in hot water.;;When not keeping house,, he sat in the back yard,, called the patio by the;real estate agent,, in an old broken deck chair. He went out to it;immediately after breakfast to bake himself in the sun. In one of the;closets he had found a tattered book and he held it in his lap without;looking at it.;;There was a much better view to be had in any direction other than the;one he faced. By moving his chair in a quarter circle he could have seen;a large part of the canyon twisting down to the city below. He never;thought of making this shift. From where he sat,, he saw the closed door;of the garage and a patch of its shabby,, tarpaper roof. In the foreground;was a sooty,, brick incinerator and a pile of rusty cans. A little to the;right of them were the remains of a cactus garden in which a few ragged,,;tortured plants still survived.;;One of these,, a clump of thick,, paddlelike blades,, covered with ugly;needles,, was in bloom. From the tip of several of its topmost blades;protruded a bright yellow flower,, somewhat like a thistle blossom but;coarser. No matter how hard the wind blew,, its petals never trembled. A;lizard lived in a hole near the base of this plant. It was about five;inches long and had a wedge-shaped head from which darted a fine,, forked;tongue. It earned a hard living catching the flies that strayed over to;the cactus from the pile of cans.;;The lizard was self-conscious and irritable,, and Homer found it very;amusing to watch. Whenever one of its elaborate stalks were foiled,, it;would shift about uneasily on its short legs and puff out its throat. Its;coloring matched the cactus perfectly,, but when it moved over to the cans;where the flies were thick,, it stood out very plainly. It would sit on;the cactus by the hour without moving,, then become impatient and start;for the cans. The flies would spot it immediately and after several;misses,, it would sneak back sheepishly to its original post.;;Homer was on the side of the flies. Whenever one of them,, swinging too;widely,, would pass the cactus,, he prayed silently for it to keep on going;or turn back. If it lighted,, he watched the lizard begin its stalk and;held his breath until it had killed,, hoping all the while that something;would warn the fly. But no matter how much he wanted the fly to escape,,;he never thought of interfering,, and was careful not to budge or make the;slightest noise. Occasionally the lizard would miscalculate. When that;happened Homer would laugh happily.;;Between the sun,, the lizard and the house,, he was fairly well occupied.;But whether he was happy or not it is hard to say. Probably he was;neither,, just as a plant is neither. He had memories to disturb him and a;plant hasn't,, but after the first bad night his memories were quiet.;;;11;;;He had been living this way for almost a month,, when,, one day,, just as he;was about to prepare his lunch,, the door bell rang. He opened it and;found a man standing on the step with a sample case in one hand and a;derby hat in the other. Homer hurriedly shut the door again.;;The bell continued to ring. He put his head out of the window nearest the;door to order the fellow away,, but the man bowed very politely and begged;for a drink of water. Homer saw that he was old and tired and thought;that he looked harmless. He got a bottle of water from the icebox,, then;opened the door and asked him in.;;The name,, sir,, is Harry Greener,, the man announced in sing-song,,;stressing every other syllable.;;Homer handed him a glass of water. He swallowed it quickly,, then poured;himself another.;;Much obliged,, he said with an elaborate bow. That was indeed;refreshing.;;Homer was astonished when he bowed again,, did several quick jig steps,,;then let his derby hat roll down his arm. It fell to the floor. He;stooped to retrieve it,, straightening up with a jerk as though he had;been kicked,, then rubbed the seat of his trousers ruefully.;;Homer understood that this was to amuse,, so he laughed.;;Harry thanked him by bowing again,, but something went wrong. The exertion;had been too much for him. His face blanched and he fumbled with his;collar.;;A momentary indisposition,, he murmured,, wondering himself whether he;was acting or sick.;;Sit down,, Homer said.;;But Harry wasn't through with his performance. He assumed a gallant smile;and took a few unsteady steps toward the couch,, then tripped himself. He;examined the carpet indignantly,, made believe he had found the object;that had tripped him and kicked it away. He then limped to the couch and;sat down with a whistling sigh like air escaping from a toy balloon.;;Homer poured more water. Harry tried to stand up,, but Homer pressed him;back and made him drink sitting. He drank this glass as he had the other;two,, in quick gulps,, then wiped his mouth with his handkerchief,,;imitating a man with a big mustache who had just drunk a glass of foamy;beer.;;You are indeed kind,, sir,, he said. Never fear,, some day I'll repay you;a thousandfold.;;Homer clucked.;;From his pocket Harry brought out a small can and held it out for him to;take.;;Compliments of the house,, he announced. 'Tis a box of Miracle;Solvent,, the modern polish par excellence,, the polish without peer or;parallel,, used by all the movie stars...;;He broke off his spiel with a trilling laugh.;;Homer took the can.;;Thank you,, he said,, trying to appear grateful. H much is it?;;The ordinary price,, the retail price,, is fifty cents,, but you can have;it for the extraordinary price of a quarter,, the wholesale price,, the;price I pay at the factory.;;A quarter? asked Homer,, habit for the moment having got the better of;his timidity. I can buy one twice that size for a quarter in the store.;;Harry knew his man.;;Take it,, take it for nothing,, he said contemptuously. Homer was tricked;into protesting.;;I guess maybe this is a much better polish.;;No,, said Harry,, as though he were spurning a bribe. Keep your money. I;don't want it.;;He laughed,, this time bitterly.;;Homer pulled out some change and offered it.;;Take it,, please. You need it,, I'm sure. I'll have two cans.;;Harry had his man where he wanted him. He began to practice a variety of;laughs,, all of them theatrical,, like a musician tuning up before a;concert. He finally found the right one and let himself go. It was a;victim's laugh.;;Please stop,, Homer said.;;But Harry couldn't stop. He was really sick. The last block that held him;poised over the runway of self-pity had been knocked away and he was;sliding down the chute,, gaining momentum all the time. He jumped to his;feet and began doing Harry Greener,, poor Harry,, honest Harry,,;well-meaning,, humble,, deserving,, a good husband,, a model father,, a;faithful Christian,, a loyal friend.;;Homer didn't appreciate the performance in the least. He was terrified;and wondered whether to phone the police. But he did nothing. He just;held up his hand for Harry to stop.;;At the end of his pantomime,, Harry stood with his head thrown back,,;clutching his throat,, as though waiting for the curtain to fall. Homer;poured him still another glass of water. But Harry wasn't finished. He;bowed,, sweeping his hat to his heart,, then began again. He didn't get;very far this time and had to gasp painfully for breath. Suddenly,, like a;mechanical toy that had been overwound,, something snapped inside of him;and he began to spin through his entire repertoire. The effort was purely;muscular,, like the dance of a paralytic. He jigged,, juggled his hat,, made;believe he had been kicked,, tripped,, and shook hands with himself. He;went through it all in one dizzy spasm,, then reeled to the couch and;collapsed.;;He lay on the couch with his eyes closed and his chest heaving. He was;even more surprised than Homer. He had put on his performance four or;five times already that day and nothing like this had happened. He was;really sick.;;You've had a fit,, Homer said when Harry opened his eyes.;;As the minutes passed,, Harry began to feel better and his confidence;returned. He pushed all thought of sickness out of his mind and even went;so far as' to congratulate himself on having given the finest performance;of his career. He should be able to get five dollars out of the big dope;who was leaning over him.;;Have you any spirits in the house? he asked weakly.;;The grocer had sent Homer a bottle of port wine on approval and he went;to get it. He filled a tumbler half full and handed it to Harry,, who;drank it in small sips,, making the faces that usually go with medicine.;;Speaking slowly,, as though in great pain,, he then asked Homer to bring in;his sample case.;;It's on the doorstep. Somebody might steal it. The greater part of my;small capital is invested in those cans of polish?;;When Homer stepped outside to obey,, he saw a girl near the curb. It was;Faye Greener. She was looking at the house.;;Is my father in there? she called out;;Mr. Greener?;;She stamped her foot.;;Tell him to get a move on,, damn it. I don't want to stay here all day.;;He's sick.;;The girl turned away without giving any sign that she either heard or;cared.;;Homer took the sample case back into the house with him. He found Harry;pouring himself another drink.;;Pretty fair stuff,, he said,, smacking his lips over it. Pretty fair,,;all right,, all right. Might I be so bold as to ask what you pay for a...;;Homer cut him short. He didn't approve of people who drank and wanted to;get rid of him.;;Your daughter's outside,, he said with as much firmness as he could;muster. She wants you.;;Harry collapsed on the couch and began to breathe heavily. He was acting;again.;;Don't tell her,, he gasped. Don't tell her how sick her old daddy is.;She must never know.;;Homer was shocked by his hypocrisy.;;You're better,, he said as coldly as he could. Why don't you go home?;;Harry smiled to show how offended and hurt he was by the heartless;attitude of his host. When Homer said nothing,, his smile became one;expressing boundless courage. He got carefully to his feet,, stood erect;for a minute,, then began to sway weakly and tumbled back on the couch.;I'm faint,, he groaned.;;Once again he was surprised and frightened. He was faint.;;Get my daughter,, he gasped.;;Homer found her standing at the curb with her back to the house. When he;called her,, she whirled and came running toward him. He watched her for a;second,, then went in,, leaving the door unlatched.;;Faye burst into the room. She ignored Homer and went straight to the;couch.;;Now what in hell's the matter? she exploded.;;Darling daughter,, he said. I have been badly taken,, and this gentleman;has been kind enough to let me rest for a moment.;;He had a fit or something,, Homer said.;;She whirled around on him so suddenly that he was startled.;;How do you do? she said,, holding her hand forward and high up.;;He shook it gingerly.;;Charmed,, she said,, when he mumbled something. She spun around once;more.;;It's my heart,, Harry said. I can't stand up.;;The little performance he put on to sell polish was familiar to her and;she knew that this wasn't part of it. When she turned to face Homer;again,, she looked quite tragic. Her head,, instead of being held far back,,;now drooped forward.;;Please let him rest there,, she said.;;Yes,, of course.;;Homer motioned her toward a chair,, then got her a match for her;cigarette. He tried not to stare at her,, but his good manners were;wasted. Faye enjoyed being stared at.;;He thought her extremely beautiful,, but what affected him still more was;her vitality. She was taut and vibrant. She was as shiny as a new spoon.;;Although she was seventeen,, she was dressed like a child of twelve in a;white cotton dress with a blue sailor collar. Her long legs were bare and;she had blue sandals on her feet.;;I'm so sorry,, she said when Homer looked at her father again.;;He made a motion with his hand to show that it was nothing.;;He has a vile heart,, poor dear,, she went on. I've begged and begged;him to go to a specialist,, but you men are all alike.;;Yes,, he ought to go to a doctor,, Homer said.;;Her odd mannerisms and artificial voice puzzled him. What time is it?;she asked.;;About one o'clock.;;She stood up suddenly and buried both her hands in her hair at the sides;of her head,, making it bunch at the top in a shiny ball.;;Oh,, she gasped prettily,, and I had a luncheon date.;;Still holding her hair,, she turned at the waist without moving her legs,,;so that her snug dress twisted even tighter and Homer could see her;dainty,, arched ribs and little,, dimpled belly. This elaborate gesture,,;like all her others,, was so completely meaningless,, almost formal,, that;she seemed a dancer rather than an affected actress.;;Do you like salmon salad? Homer ventured to ask.;;Salmon sal-ahde?;;She seemed to be repeating the question to her stomach. The answer was;yes.;;With plenty of mayonnaise,, huh? I adore it.;;I was going to have some for lunch. I'll finish making it.;;Let me help.;;They looked at Harry,, who appeared to be asleep,, then went into the;kitchen. While he opened a can of salmon,, she climbed on a chair and;straddled it with her arms folded across the top of its back and rested;her chin on her arms. Whenever he looked at her,, she smiled intimately;and tossed her pale,, glittering hair first forward,, then back.;;Homer was excited and his hands worked quickly. He soon had a large bowl;of salad ready. He set the table with his best cloth and his best silver;and china.;;It makes me hungry just to look,, she said.;;The way she said this seemed to mean that it was Homer who made her;hungry and he beamed at her. But before he had a chance to sit down,, she;was already eating. She buttered a slice of bread,, covered the butter;with sugar and took a big bite. Then she quickly smeared a gob of;mayonnaise on the salmon and went to work. Just as he was about to sit;down,, she asked for something to drink. He poured her a glass of milk and;stood watching her like a waiter. He was unaware of her rudeness.;;As soon as she had gobbled up her salad,, he brought her a large red;apple. She ate the fruit more slowly,, nibbling daintily,, her smallest;finger curled away from the rest of her hand. When she had finished it,,;she went back to the living room and Homer followed her.;;Harry still lay as they had left him,, stretched out on the sofa. The;heavy noon-day sun hit directly on his face,, beating down on him like a;club. He hardly felt its blows,, however. He was busy with the stabbing;pain in his chest. He was so busy with himself that he had even stopped;trying to plan how to get money out of the big dope.;;Homer drew the window curtain to shade his face.;;Harry didn't even notice. He was thinking about death. Faye bent over;him. He saw,, from under his partially closed eyelids,, that she expected;him to make a reassuring gesture. He refused. He examined the tragic;expression that she had assumed and didn't like it. In a serious moment;like this,, her ham sorrow was insulting.;;Speak to me,, Daddy,, she begged.;;She was baiting him without being aware of it.;;What the hell is this,, he snarled,, a Tom show?;;His sudden fury scared her and she straightened up with a jerk. He didn't;want to laugh,, but a short bark escaped before he could stop it. He;waited anxiously to see what would happen. When it didn't hurt he laughed;again. He kept on,, timidly at first,, then with growing assurance. He;laughed with his eyes closed and the sweat pouring down his brow. Faye;knew only one way to stop him and that was to do something he hated as;much as she hated his laughter. She began to sing.;;Jeepers Creepers!;Where'd ya get those peepers?...;;She trucked,, jerking her buttocks and shaking her head from side to side.;;Homer was amazed. He felt that the scene he was witnessing had been;rehearsed. He was right. Their bitterest quarrels often took this form,;;he laughing,, she singing.;;Jeepers Creepers!;Where'd ya get those eyes?;Gosh,, all git up!;How'd they get so lit up?;Gosh all git...;;When Harry stopped,, she stopped and flung herself into a chair. But Harry;was only gathering strength for a final effort. He began again. This new;laugh was not critical,; it was horrible. When she was a child,, he used to;punish her with it. It was his masterpiece. There was a director who;always called on him to give it when he was shooting a scene in an insane;asylum or a haunted castle.;;It began with a sharp,, metallic crackle,, like burning sticks,, then;gradually increased in volume until it became a rapid bark,, then fell;away again to an obscene chuckle. After a slight pause,, it climbed until;it was the nicker of a horse,, then still higher to become a machinelike;screech.;;Faye listened helplessly with her head cocked on one side. Suddenly,, she;too laughed,, not willingly,, but fighting the sound.;;You bastard! she yelled.;;She leaped to the couch,, grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to shake;him quiet.;;He kept laughing.;;Homer moved as though he meant to pull her away,, but he lost courage and;was afraid to touch her. She was so naked under her skimpy dress.;;Miss Greener,, he pleaded,, making his big hands dance at the end of his;arms. Please,, please...;;Harry couldn't stop laughing now. He pressed his belly with his hands,,;but the noise poured out of him. It had begun to hurt again.;;Swinging her hand as though it held a hammer,, she brought her fist down;hard on his mouth. She hit him only once. He relaxed and was quiet.;;I had to do it,, she said to Homer when he took her arm and led her;away.;;He guided her to a chair in the kitchen and shut the door. She continued;to sob for a long time. He stood behind her chair,, helplessly,, watching;the rhythmical heave of her shoulders. Several times his hands moved;forward to comfort her,, but he succeeded in curbing them.;;When she was through crying,, he handed her a napkin and she dried her;face. The cloth was badly stained by her rouge and mascara.;;I've spoilt it,, she said,, keeping her face averted. I'm very sorry.;;It was dirty,, Homer said.;;She took a compact from her pocket and looked at herself in its tiny;mirror.;;I'm a fright.;;She asked if she could use the bathroom and he showed her where it was.;He then tiptoed into the living room to see Harry. The old man's;breathing was noisy but regular and he seemed to be sleeping quietly.;Homer put a cushion under his head without disturbing him and went back;into the kitchen. He lit the stove and put the coffeepot on the flame,,;then sat down to wait for the girl to return: He heard her go into the;living room. A few seconds later she came into the kitchen.;;She hesitated apologetically in the doorway.;;Won't you have some coffee?;;Without waiting for her to reply,, he poured a cup and moved the sugar and;cream so that she could reach them. I had to do it,, she said. I just;had to.;;That's all right.;;To show her that it wasn't necessary to apologize,, he busied himself at;the sink.;;No,, I had to,, she insisted. He laughs that way just to drive me wild.;I can't stand it. I simply can't.;;Yes.;;He's crazy. We Greeners are all crazy.;;She made this last statement as though there were merit in being crazy.;;He's pretty sick,, Homer said,, apologizing for her. Maybe he had a;sunstroke.;;No,, he's crazy.;;He put a plate of gingersnaps on the table and she ate them with her;second cup of coffee. The dainty crunching sound she made chewing;fascinated him.;;When she remained quiet for several minutes,, he turned from the sink to;see if anything was wrong. She was smoking a cigarette and seemed lost in;thought.;;He tried to be gay.;;What are you thinking? he said awkwardly,, then felt foolish.;;She sighed to show how dark and foreboding her thoughts were,, but didn't;reply.;;I'll bet you would like some candy,, Homer said. There isn't any in the;house,, but I could call the drugstore and they'd send it right over. Or;some ice cream?;;No,, thanks,, please.;;It's no trouble.;;My father isn't really a peddler,, she said,, abruptly. He's an actor.;I'm an actress. My mother was also an actress,, a dancer. The theatre is;in our blood.;;I haven't seen many shows. I...;;He broke off because he saw that she wasn't interested. I'm going to be;a star some day,, she announced as though daring him to contradict her.;;I'm sure you...;;It's my life. It's the only thing in the whole world that I want.;;It's good to know what you want. I used to be a bookkeeper in a hotel,,;but...;;If I'm not,, I'll commit suicide.;;She stood up and put her hands to her hair,, opened her eyes wide and;frowned.;;I don't go to shows very often,, he apologized,, pushing the gingersnaps;toward her. The lights hurt my eyes. She laughed and took a cracker.;;I'll get fat.;;Oh,, no.;;They say fat women are going to be popular next year. Do you think so? I;don't. It's just publicity for Mae West. He agreed with her.;;She talked on and on,, endlessly,, about herself and about the picture;business. He watched her,, but didn't listen,, and whenever she repeated a;question in order to get a reply,, he nodded his head without saying;anything.;;His hands began to bother him. He rubbed them against the edge of the;table to relieve their itch,, but it only stimulated them. When he clasped;them behind his back,, the strain became intolerable. They were hot and;swollen. Using the dishes as an excuse,, he held them under the cold water;tap of the sink.;;Faye was still talking when Harry appeared in the doorway. He leaned;weakly against the door jamb. His nose was very red,, but the rest of his;face was drained white and he seemed to have grown too small for his;clothing. He was smiling,, however.;;To Homer's amazement,, they greeted each other as though nothing had;happened.;;You okay now,, Pop?;;Fine and dandy,, baby. Right as rain,, fit as a fiddle and lively as a;flea,, as the feller says.;;The nasal twang he used in imitation of a country yokel made Homer smile.;;Do you want something to eat? he asked. A glass of milk,, maybe?;;I could do with a snack.;;Faye helped him over to the table. He tried to disguise how weak he was;by doing an exaggerated Negro shuffle. Homer opened a can of sardines and;sliced some bread. Harry smacked his lips over the food,, but ate slowly;and with an effort.;;That hit the spot,, all righty right,, he said when he had finished.;;He leaned back and fished a crumpled cigar butt out of his vest pocket.;Faye lit it for him and he playfully blew a puff of smoke in her face.;;We'd better go,, Daddy,, she said.;;In a jiffy,, child.;;He turned to Homer.;;Nice place you've got here. Married?;;Faye tried to interfere.;;Dad!;;He ignored her.;;Bachelor,, eh?;;Yes.;;Well,, well,, a young fellow like you.;;I'm here for my health,, Homer found it necessary to say.;;Don't answer his questions,, Faye broke in.;;Now,, now,, daughter,, I'm just being friendly like. I don't mean no harm.;;He was still using an exaggerated backwoods accent. He spat dry into an;imaginary spittoon and made believe he was shifting a cud of tobacco from;cheek to cheek.;;Homer thought his mimicry funny.;;I'd be lonesome and scared living alone in a big house like this,, Harry;went on. Don't you ever get lonesome?;;Homer looked at Faye for his answer. She was frowning with annoyance.;;No,, he said,, to prevent Harry from repeating the uncomfortable;question.;;No? Well,, that's fine.;;He blew several smoke rings at the ceiling and watched their behavior;judiciously.;;Did you ever think of taking boarders? he asked.;;Some nice,, sociable folks,, I mean. It'll bring in a little extra money;and make things more homey.;;Homer was indignant,, but underneath his indignation lurked another idea,,;a very exciting one. He didn't know what to say.;;Faye misunderstood his agitation.;;Cut it out,, Dad,, she exclaimed before Homer could reply. You've been a;big enough nuisance already.;;Just chinning,, he protested innocently. Just chewin' the fat.;;Well,, then,, let's get going,, she snapped.;;There's plenty of time,, Homer said.;;He wanted to add something stronger,, but didn't have the courage. His;hands were braver. When Faye shook good-bye,, they clutched and refused to;let go.;;Faye laughed at their warm insistence.;;Thanks a million,, Mr. Simpson,, she said. You've been very kind. Thanks;for the lunch and for helping Daddy.;;We're very grateful,, Harry chimed in. You've done a Christian deed;this day. God will reward you.;;He had suddenly become very pious.;;Please look us up,, Faye said. We live close-by in the San Berdoo;Apartments,, about five blocks down the canyon. It's the big yellow;house.;;When Harry stood,, he had to lean against the table for support. Faye and;Homer each took him by the arm and helped him into the street. Homer held;him erect,, while Faye went to get their Ford which was parked across the;street.;;We're forgetting your order of Miracle Salve,, Harry said,, the polish;without peer or parallel.;;Homer found a dollar and slipped it into his hand. He hid the money;quickly and tried to become businesslike.;;I'll leave the goods tomorrow.;;Yes,, that'll be fine,, Homer said. I really need some silver polish.;;Harry was angry because it hurt him to be patronized by a sucker. He made;an attempt to re-establish what he considered to be their proper;relationship by bowing ironically,, but didn't get very far with the;gesture and began to fumble with his Adam's apple. Homer helped him into;the car and he slumped down in the seat beside Faye. They drove off. She;turned to wave,, but Harry didn't even look back.;;;12;;;Homer spent the rest of the afternoon in the broken deck chair. The;lizard was on the cactus,, but he took little interest in its hunting. His;hands kept his thoughts busy. They trembled and jerked,, as though;troubled by dreams. To hold them still,, he clasped them together. Their;fingers twined like a tangle of thighs in miniature. He snatched them;apart and sat on them.;;When the days passed and he couldn't forget Faye,, he began to grow;frightened. He somehow knew that his only defense was chastity,, that it;served him,, like the shell of a tortoise,, as both spine and armor. He;couldn't shed it even in thought. If he did,, he would be destroyed.;;He was right. There are men who can lust with parts of themselves. Only;their brain or their hearts burn and then not completely. There are;others,, still more fortunate,, who are like the filaments of an;incandescent lamp. They bum fiercely,, yet nothing is destroyed. But in;Homer's case it would be like dropping a spark into a barn full of hay.;He had escaped in the Romola Martin incident,, but he wouldn't escape;again. Then,, for one thing,, he had had his job in the hotel,, a daily;all-day task that protected him by tiring him,, but now he had nothing.;;His thoughts frightened him and he bolted into the house,, hoping to leave;them behind like a hat. He ran into his bedroom and threw himself down on;the bed. He was simple enough to believe that people don't think while;asleep.;;In his troubled state,, even this delusion was denied him and he was;unable to fall asleep. He closed his eyes and tried to make himself;drowsy. The approach to sleep which had once been automatic had somehow;become a long,, shining tunnel. Sleep was at the far end of it,, a soft bit;of shadow in the hard glare. He couldn't run,, only crawl toward the black;patch. Just as he was about to give up,, habit came to his rescue. It;collapsed the shining tunnel and hurled him into the shadow.;;When he awoke it was without a struggle. He tried to fall asleep once;more,, but this time couldn't even find the tunnel. He was thoroughly;awake. He tried to think of how very tired he was,, but he wasn't tired.;He felt more alive than he had at any time since Romola Martin.;;Outside a few birds still sang intermittently,, starting and breaking off,,;as though sorry to acknowledge the end of another day. He thought that he;heard the lisp of silk against silk,, but it was only the wind playing in;the trees. How empty the house was! He tried to fill it by singing.;;Oh,, say can you see,,;By the dawn's early light...;;It was the only song he knew. He thought of buying a victrola or a radio.;He knew,, however,, that he would buy neither. This fact made him very sad.;It was a pleasant sadness,, very sweet and calm.;;But he couldn't let well enough alone. He was impatient and began to prod;at his sadness,, hoping to make it acute and so still more pleasant. He;had been getting pamphlets in the mail from a travel bureau and he;thought of the trips he would never take. Mexico was only a few hundred;miles away. Boats left daily for Hawaii.;;His sadness turned to anguish before he knew it and became sour. He was;miserable again. He began to cry.;;Only those who still have hope can benefit from tears. When they finish,,;they feel better. But to those without hope,, like Homer,, whose anguish is;basic and permanent,, no good comes from crying. Nothing changes for them.;They usually know this,, but still can't help crying.;;Homer was lucky. He cried himself to sleep.;;But he awoke again in the morning with Faye uppermost in his mind. He;bathed,, ate breakfast and sat in his deck chair. In the afternoon,, he;decided to go for a walk. There was only one way for him to go and that;led past the San Bernardino Apartments.;;Some time during his long sleep he had given up the battle. When he came;to the apartment house,, he peered into the amber-lit hallway and read the;Greener card on the letter box,, then turned and went home. On the next;night,, he repeated the trip,, carrying a gift of flowers and wine.;;;13;;;Harry Greener's condition didn't improve. He remained' in bed,, staring at;the ceiling with his hands folded on his chest.;;Tod went to see him almost every night. There were usually other guests.;Sometimes Abe Kusich,, sometimes Anna and Annabelle Lee,, a sister act of;the nineteen-tens,, more often the four Gingos,, a family of performing;Eskimos from Point Barrow,, Alaska.;;If Harry were asleep or there were visitors,, Faye usually invited Tod;into her room for a talk. His interest in her grew despite the things she;said and he continued to find her very exciting. Had any other girl been;so affected,, he would have thought her intolerable. Faye's affectations,,;however,, were so completely artificial that he found them charming.;;Being with her was like being backstage during an amateurish,, ridiculous;play. From in front,, the stupid lines and grotesque situations would have;made him squirm with annoyance,, but because he saw the perspiring;stagehands and the wires that held up the tawdry summerhouse with its;tangle of paper flowers,, he accepted everything and was anxious for it to;succeed.;;He found still another way to excuse her. He believed that while she;often recognized the falseness of an attitude,, she persisted in it;because she didn't know how to be simpler or more honest. She was an;actress who had learned from bad models in a bad school.;;Yet Faye did have some critical ability,, almost enough to recognize the;ridiculous. He had often seen her laugh at herself. What was more,, he had;even seen her laugh at her dreams.;;One evening they talked about what she did with herself when she wasn't;working as an extra. She told him that she often spent the whole day;making up stories. She laughed as she said it. When he questioned her,,;she described her method quite willingly.;;She would get some music on the radio,, then lie down on her bed and shut;her eyes. She had a large assortment of stories to choose from. After;getting herself in the right mood,, she would go over them in her mind,, as;though they were a pack of cards,, discarding one after another until she;found the one that suited. On some days,, she would run through the whole;pack without making a choice. When that happened,, she would either go to;Vine Street for an ice cream soda or,, if she was broke,, thumb over the;pack again and force herself to choose.;;While she admitted that her method was too mechanical for the best;results and that it was better to slip into a dream naturally,, she said;that any dream was better than no dream and beggars couldn't be choosers.;She hadn't exactly said this,, but he was able to understand it from what;she did say. He thought it important that she smiled while telling him,,;not with embarrassment,, but critically. However,, her critical powers;ended there. She only smiled at the mechanics.;;The first time he had ever heard one of her dreams was late at night in;her bedroom. About half an hour earlier,, she had knocked on his door and;had asked him to come and help her with Harry because she thought he was;dying. His noisy breathing,, which she had taken for the death rattle,, had;awakened her and she was badly frightened. Tod put on his bathrobe and;followed her downstairs. When he got to the apartment,, Harry had managed;to clear his throat and his breathing had become quiet again.;;She invited him into her room for a smoke. She sat on the bed and he sat;beside her. She was wearing an old beach robe of white toweling over her;pajamas and it was very becoming.;;He wanted to beg her for a kiss but was afraid,, not because she would;refuse,, but because she would insist on making it meaningless. To flatter;her,, he commented on her appearance. He did a bad job of it. He was;incapable of direct flattery and got bogged down in a much too roundabout;observation. She didn't listen and he broke off feeling like an idiot.;;I've got a swell idea,, she said suddenly. An idea how we can make some;real money.;;He made another attempt to flatter her. This time by assuming an attitude;of serious interest.;;You're educated,, she said. Well,, I've got some swell ideas for;pictures. All you got to do is write them up and then we'll sell them to;the studios.;;He agreed and she described her plan. It was very vague until she came to;what she considered would be its results,, then she went into concrete;details. As soon as they had sold one story,, she would give him another.;They would make loads and loads of money. Of course she wouldn't give up;acting,, even if she was a big success as a writer,, because acting was her;life.;;He realized as she went on that she was manufacturing another dream to;add to her already very thick pack. When she finally got through spending;the money,, he asked her to tell him the idea he was to write up,,;keeping all trace of irony out of his voice.;;On the wall of the room beyond the foot of her bed was a large photograph;that must have once been used in the lobby of a theatre to advertise a;Tarzan picture. It showed a beautiful young man with magnificent muscles,,;wearing only a narrow loin cloth,, who was ardently squeezing a slim girl;in a torn riding habit. They stood in a jungle clearing and all around;the pair writhed great vines loaded with fat orchids. When she told her;story,, he knew that this photograph had a lot to do with inspiring it.;;A young girl is cruising on her father's yacht in the South Seas. She is;engaged to marry a Russian count,, who is tall,, thin and old,, but with;beautiful manners. He is on the yacht,, too,, and keeps begging her to name;the day. But she is spoiled and won't do it. Maybe she became engaged to;him in order to spite another man. She becomes interested in a young;sailor who is far below her in station,, but very handsome. She flirts;with him because she is bored. The sailor refuses to be toyed with no;matter how much money she's got and tells her that he only takes orders;from the captain and to go back to her foreigner. She gets sore as hell;and threatens to have him fired,, but he only laughs at her. How can he be;fired in the middle of the ocean? She falls in love with him,, although;maybe she doesn't realize it herself,, because he is the first man who has;ever said no to one of her whims and because he is so handsome. Then;there is a big storm and the yacht is wrecked near an island. Everybody;is drowned,, but she manages to swim to shore. She makes herself a hut of;boughs and lives on fish and fruit. It's the tropics. One morning,, while;she is bathing naked in a brook,, a big snake grabs her. She struggles but;the snake is too strong for her and it looks like curtains. But the;sailor,, who has been watching her from behind some bushes,, leaps to her;rescue. He fights the snake for her and wins.;;Tod was to go on from there. He asked her how she thought the picture;should end,, but she seemed to have lost interest. He insisted on hearing,,;however.;;Well,, he marries her,, of course,, and they're rescued. First they're;rescued and then they're married,, I mean. Maybe he turns out to be a rich;boy who is being a sailor just for the adventure of it,, or something like;that. You can work it out easy enough.;;It's sure-fire,, Tod said earnestly,, staring at her wet lips and the;tiny point of her tongue which she kept moving between them.;;I've got just hundreds and hundreds more.;;He didn't say anything and her manner changed. While telling the story,,;she had been full of surface animation and her hands and face were alive;with little illustrative grimaces and gestures. But now her excitement;narrowed and became deeper and its play internal. He guessed that she;must be thumbing over her pack and that she would soon select another;card to show him.;;He had often seen her like this,, but had never before understood it. All;these little stories,, these little daydreams of hers,, were what gave such;extraordinary color and mystery to her movements. She seemed always to be;struggling in their soft grasp as though she were trying to run in a;swamp. As he watched her,, he felt sure that her lips must taste of blood;and salt and that there must be a delicious weakness in her legs. His;impulse wasn't to aid her to get free,, but to throw her down in the soft,,;warm mud and to keep her there.;;He expressed some of his desire by a grunt. If he only had the courage to;throw himself on her. Nothing less violent than rape would do. The;sensation he felt was like that he got when holding an egg in his hand.;Not that she was fragile or even seemed fragile. It wasn't that. It was;her completeness,, her egglike self-sufficiency,, that made him want to;crush her.;;But he did nothing and she began to talk again.;;I've got another swell idea that I want to tell you. Maybe you had;better write this one up first. It's a backstage story and they're;making a lot of them this year.;;She told him about a young chorus girl who gets her big chance when the;star of the show falls sick. It was a familiar version of the Cinderella;theme,, but her technique was much different from the one she had used for;the South Sea tale. Although the events she described were miraculous,,;her description of them was realistic. The effect was similar to that;obtained by the artists of the Middle Ages,, who,, when doing a subject;like the raising of Lazarus from the dead or Christ walking on water,,;were careful to keep all the details intensely realistic. She,, like them,,;seemed to think that fantasy could be made plausible by a humdrum;technique.;;I like that one,, too,, he said when she had finished.;;Think them over and do the one that has the best chance.;;She was dismissing him and if he didn't act at once the opportunity would;be gone. He started to lean toward her,, but she caught his meaning and;stood up. She took his arm with affectionate brusqueness--they were now;business partners--and guided him to the door.;;In the hall,, when she thanked him for coming down and apologized for;having disturbed him,, he tried again. She seemed to melt a little and he;reached for her. She kissed him willingly enough,, but when he tried to;extend the caress,, she tore free.;;Whoa there,, palsy-walsy,, she laughed. Mamma spank. He started for the;stairs.;;Good-bye now,, she called after him,, then laughed again.;;He barely heard her. He was thinking of the drawings he had made of her;and of the new one he would do as soon as he got to his room.;;In The Burning of Los Angeles Faye is the naked girl in the left;foreground being chased by the group of men and women who have separated;from the main body of the mob. One of the women is about to hurl a rock;at her to bring her down. She is running with her eyes closed and a;strange half-smile on her lips. Despite the dreamy repose of her face,,;her body is straining to hurl her along at top speed. The only;explanation for this contrast is that she is enjoying the release that;wild flight gives in much the same way that a game bird must when,, after;hiding for several tense minutes,, it bursts from cover in complete,,;unthinking panic.;;;14;;;Tod had other and more successful rivals than Homer Simpson. One of the;most important was a young man called Earle Shoop.;;Earle was a cowboy from a small town in Arizona. He worked occasionally;in horse-operas and spent the rest of his time in front of a saddlery;store on Sunset Boulevard. In the window of this store was an enormous;Mexican saddle covered with carved silver,, and around it was arranged a;large collection of torture instruments. Among other things there were;fancy,, braided quirts,, spurs with great spiked wheels,, and double bits;that looked as though they could break a horse's jaw without trouble.;Across the back of the window ran a low shelf on which was a row of;boots,, some black,, some red and some a pale yellow. All of the boots had;scalloped tops and very high heels.;;Earle always stood with his back to the window,, his eyes fixed on a sign;on the roof of a one-story building across the street that read: Malted;Milks Too Thick For A Straw. Regularly,, twice every hour,, he pulled a;sack of tobacco and a sheaf of papers from his shirt pocket and rolled a;cigarette. Then he tightened the cloth of his trousers by lifting his;knee and struck a match along the underside of his thigh.;;He was over six feet tall. The big Stetson hat he wore added five inches;more to his height and the heels of his boots still another three. His;polelike appearance was further exaggerated by the narrowness of his;shoulders and by his lack of either hips or buttocks. The years he had;spent in the saddle had not made him bowlegged. In fact his legs were so;straight that his dungarees,, bleached very light blue by the sun and much;washing,, hung down without a wrinkle,, as though they were empty.;;Tod could see why Faye thought him handsome. He had a two-dimensional;face that a talented child might have drawn with a ruler and a compass.;His chin was perfectly round and his eyes,, which were wide apart,, were;also round. His thin mouth ran at right angles to his straight,,;perpendicular nose. His reddish tan complexion was the same color from;hairline to throat,, as though washed in by an expert,, and it completed;his resemblance to a mechanical drawing.;;Tod had told Faye that Earle was a dull fool. She agreed laughing,, but;then said that he was criminally handsome,, an expression she had picked;up in the chatter column of a trade paper.;;Meeting her on the stairs one night,, Tod asked if she would go to dinner;with him.;;I can't. I've got a date. But you can come along.;;With Earle?;;Yes,, with Earle,, she repeated,, mimicking his annoyance.;;No,, thanks.;;She misunderstood,, perhaps on purpose,, and said,, He'll treat this time.;;Earle was always broke and whenever Tod went with them he was the one who;paid.;;That isn't it,, and you damn well know it.;;Oh,, isn't it? she asked archly,, then,, absolutely sure of herself,,;added,, Meet us at Hodge's around five.;;Hodge's was the saddlery store. When Tod got there,, he found Earle Shoop;at his usual post,, just standing and just looking at the sign across the;street. He had on his ten-gallon hat and his high-heeled boots. Neatly;folded over his left arm was a dark gray jacket. His shirt was navy-blue;cotton with large polka dots,, each the size of a dime. The sleeves of his;shirt were not rolled,, but pulled to the middle of his forearm and held;there by a pair of fancy,, rose armbands. His hands were the same clean;reddish tan as his face.;;Lo,, thar,, was the way he returned Tod's salute.;;Tod found his Western accent amusing. The first time he had heard it,, he;had replied,, Lo,, thar,, stranger,, and had been surprised to discover;that Earle didn't know he was being kidded. Even when Tod talked about;cayuses,, mean hombres and rustlers,, Earle took him seriously.;;Howdy,, partner,, Tod said.;;Next to Earle was another Westerner in a big hat and boots,, sitting on;his heels and chewing vigorously on a little twig. Close behind him was a;battered paper valise held together by heavy rope tied with;professional-looking knots.;;Soon after Tod arrived a third man came along. He made a thorough;examination of the merchandise in the window,, then turned and began to;stare across the street like the other two.;;He was middle-aged and looked like an exercise boy from a racing stable.;His face was completely covered with a fine mesh of wrinkles,, as though;he had been sleeping with it pressed against a roll of rabbit wire. He;was very shabby and had probably sold his big hat,, but he still had his;boots.;;Lo,, boys,, he said.;;Lo,, Hink,, said the man with the paper valise.;;Tod didn't know whether he was included in the greeting,, but took a;chance and replied.;;Howdy.;;Hink prodded the valise with his toe.;;Coin' some place,, Calvin? he asked.;;Azusa,, there's a rodeo.;;Who's running it?;;A fellow calls himself 'Badlands jack.';;That grifter!...You goin',, Earle?;;Nope.;;I gotta eat,, said Calvin.;;Hink carefully considered all the information he had received before;speaking again.;;Mono's makin' a new Buck Stevens,, he said. Will Ferris told me they'd;use more than forty riders.;;Calvin turned and looked up at Earle.;;Still got the piebald vest? he asked slyly.;;Why?;;It'll cinch you a job as a road agent.;;Tod understood that this was a joke of some sort because Calvin and Hink;chuckled and slapped their thighs loudly while Earle frowned.;;There was another long silence,, then Calvin spoke again. Ain't your old;man still got some cows? he asked Earle. But Earle was wary this time;and refused to answer. Calvin winked at Tod,, slowly and elaborately,,;contorting one whole side of his face.;;That's right,, Earle,, Hink said. Your old man's still got some stock.;Why don't you go home?;;They couldn't get a rise out of Earle,, so Calvin answered the question.;;He dassint. He got caught in a sheep car with a pair of rubber boots on.;;It was another joke. Calvin and Hink slapped their thighs and laughed,,;but Tod could see that they were waiting for something else. Earle,,;suddenly,, without even shifting his weight,, shot his foot out and kicked;Calvin solidly in the rump. This was the real point of the joke. They;were delighted by Earle's fury. Tod also laughed. The way Earle had gone;from apathy to action without the usual transition was funny. The;seriousness of his violence was even funnier.;;A little while later,, Faye drove by in her battered Ford touring car and;pulled into the curb some twenty feet away. Calvin and Hink waved,, but;Earle didn't budge. He took his time,, as befitted his dignity. Not until;she tooted her horn did he move. Tod followed a short distance behind;him.;;Hi,, cowboy,, said Faye gaily.;;Lo,, honey,, he drawled,, removing his hat carefully and replacing it with;even greater care. Faye smiled at Tod and motioned for them both to climb;in. Tod got in the back. Earle unfolded the jacket he was carrying,,;slapped it a few times to remove the wrinkles,, then put it on and;adjusted its collar and shaped the roll of its lapels. He then climbed in;beside Faye. She started the car with a jerk. When she reached LaBrea,,;she turned right to Hollywood Boulevard and then left along it. Tod could;see that she was watching Earle out of the corner of her eye and that he;was preparing to speak.;;Get going,, she said,, trying to hurry him.;;What is it?;;Looka here,, honey,, I ain't got any dough for supper. She was very much put out.;;But I told Tod we'd treat him. He's treated us enough times.;;That's all right,, Tod interposed. Next time'll do. I've got plenty of;money.;;No,, damn it,, she said without looking around. I'm sick of it.;;She pulled into the curb and slammed on the brakes.;;It's always the same story,, she said to Earle.;;He adjusted his hat,, his collar and his sleeves,, then spoke. We've got;some grub at camp.;;Beans,, I suppose.;;Nope.;;She prodded him.;;Well,, what've you got?;;Mig and me's set some traps.;;Faye laughed.;;Rat traps,, eh? We're going to eat rats.;;Earle didn't say anything.;;Listen,, you big,, strong,, silent dope,, she said,, either make sense,, or;God damn it,, get out of this car.;;They're quail traps,, he said without the slightest change in his;wooden,, formal manner.;;She ignored his explanation.;;Talking to you is like pulling teeth. You wear me out. Tod knew that;there was no hope for him in this quarrel. He had heard it all before.;;I didn't mean nothing,, Earle said. I was only funning. I wouldn't feed;you rats.;;She slammed off the emergency brake and started the car again. At;Zacarias Street,, she turned into the hills. After climbing steadily for a;quarter of a mile,, she reached a dirt road and followed it to its end.;They all climbed out,, Earle helping Faye.;;Give me a kiss,, she said,, smiling her forgiveness.;;He took his hat off ceremoniously and placed it on the hood of the car,,;then wrapped his long arms around her. They paid no attention to Tod,, who;was standing off to one side watching them. He saw Earle close his eyes;and pucker up his lips like a little boy. But there was nothing boyish;about what he did to her. When she had had as much as she wanted,, she;pushed him away.;;You,, too? she called gaily to Tod,, who had turned his back.;;Oh,, some other time,, he replied,, imitating her casualness.;;She laughed,, then took out a compact and began to fix her mouth. When she;was ready,, they started along a little path that was a continuation of;the dirt road. Earle led,, Faye came next and Tod brought up the rear.;;It was full spring. The path ran along the bottom of a narrow canyon and;wherever weeds could get a purchase in its steep banks they flowered in;purple,, blue and yellow. Orange poppies bordered the path. Their petals;were wrinkled like crepe and their leaves were heavy with talcumlike;dust.;;They climbed until they reached another canyon. This one was sterile,, but;its bare ground and jagged rocks were even more brilliantly colored than;the flowers of the first. The path was silver,, grained with streaks of;rose-gray,, and the walls of the canyon were turquoise,, mauve,, chocolate;and lavender. The air itself was vibrant pink.;;They stopped to watch a humming bird chase a blue jay. The jay flashed by;squawking with its tiny enemy on its tail like a ruby bullet. The gaudy;birds burst the colored air into a thousand glittering particles like;metal confetti.;;When they came out of this canyon,, they saw below them a little green;valley thick with trees,, mostly eucalyptus,, with here and there a poplar;and one enormous black live-oak. Sliding and stumbling down a dry wash,,;they made for the valley.;;Tod saw a man watching their approach from the edge of the wood. Faye;also saw him and waved.;;Hi,, Mig! she shouted.;;Chinita! he called back.;;She ran the last ten yards of the slope and the man caught her in his;arms.;;He was toffee-colored with large Armenian eyes and pouting black lips.;His head was a mass of tight,, ordered curls. He wore a long-haired;sweater,, called a gorilla in and around Los Angeles,, with nothing under;it. His soiled duck trousers were held up by a red bandanna handkerchief.;On his feet were a pair of tattered tennis sneakers.;;They moved on to the camp which was located in a clearing in the center;of the wood. It consisted of little more than a ramshackle hut patched;with tin signs that had been stolen from the highway and a stove without;legs or bottom set on some rocks. Near the hut was a row of chicken;coops.;;Earle started a fire under the stove while Faye sat down on a box and;watched him. Tod went over to look at the chickens. There was one old hen;and a half a dozen game cocks. A great deal of pains had been taken in;making the coops,, which were of grooved boards,, carefully matched and;joined. Their floors were freshly spread with peat moss.;;The Mexican came over and began to talk about the cocks. He was very;proud of them.;;That's Hermano,, five times winner. He's one of Street's Butcher Boys.;Pepe and El Negro are still stags. I fight them next week in San Pedro.;That's Villa,, he's a blinker,, but still good. And that one's Zapata,,;twice winner,, a Tassel Dom he is. And that's Jujutla. My champ.;;He opened the coop and lifted the bird out for Tod. A murderer is what;the guy is. Speedy and how!;;The cock's plumage was green,, bronze and copper. Its beak was lemon;and its legs orange.;;He's beautiful,, Tod said.;;I'll say.;;Mig tossed the bird back into the coop and they went back to join the;others at the fire.;;When do we eat? Faye asked.;;Miguel tested the stove by spitting on it. He next found a large iron;skillet and began to scour it with sand. Earle gave Faye a knife and some;potatoes to peel,, then picked up a burlap sack.;;I'll get the birds,, he said.;;Tod went along with him. They followed a narrow path that looked as;though it had been used by sheep until they came to a tiny field,, covered;with high,, tufted grass. Earle stopped behind a gum bush and held up his;hand to warn Tod.;;A mocking bird was singing near by. Its song was like pebbles being;dropped one by one from a height into a pool of water. Then a quail began;to call,, using two soft guttural notes. Another quail answered and the;birds talked back and forth. Their call was not like the cheerful whistle;of the Eastern bobwhite. It was full of melancholy and weariness,, yet;marvelously sweet. Still another quail joined the duet. This one called;from near the center of the field. It was a trapped bird,, but the sound;it made had no anxiety in it,, only sadness,, impersonal and without hope.;;When Earle was satisfied that no one was there to spy on his poaching,, he;went to the trap. It was a wire basket about the size of a washtub with a;small door in the top. He stooped over and began to fumble with the door.;Five birds ran wildly along the inner edge and threw themselves at the;wire. One of them,, a cock,, had a dainty plume on his head that curled;forward almost to his beak.;;Earle caught the birds one at a time and pulled their heads off before;dropping them into his sack. Then he started back. As he walked along,, he;held the sack under his left arm. He lifted the birds out with his right;hand and plucked them one at a time. Their feathers fell to the ground,,;point first,, weighed down by the tiny drop of blood that trembled on the;tips of their quills.;;The sun went down before they reached the camp again. It grew chilly and;Tod was glad of the fire. Faye shared her seat on the box with him and;they both leaned forward into the heat.;;Mig brought a jug of tequila from the hut. He filled a peanut butter jar;for Faye and passed the jug to Tod. The liquor smelled like rotten fruit,,;but he liked the taste. When he had had enough,, Earle took it and then;Miguel. They continued to pass it from hand to hand.;;Earle tried to show Faye how plump the game was,, but she wouldn't look.;He gutted the birds,, then began cutting them into quarters with a pair of;heavy tin shears. Faye held her hands over her ears in order not to hear;the soft click made by the blades as they cut through flesh and bone.;Earle wiped the pieces with a rag and dropped them into the skillet where;a large piece of lard was already sputtering.;;For all her squeamishness,, Faye ate as heartily as the men did. There was;no coffee and they finished with tequila. They smoked and kept the jug;moving. Faye tossed away the peanut butter jar and drank like the others,,;throwing her head back and tilting the jug.;;Tod could sense her growing excitement. The box on which they were;sitting was so small that their backs touched and he could feel how hot;she was and how restless. Her neck and face had turned from ivory to;rose. She kept reaching for his cigarettes.;;Earle's features were hidden in the shadow of his big hat,, but the;Mexican sat full in the light of the fire. His skin glowed and the oil in;his black curls sparkled. He kept smiling at Faye in a manner that Tod;didn't like. The more he drank,, the less he liked it.;;Faye kept crowding Tod,, so he left the box to sit on the ground where he;could watch her better. She was smiling back at the Mexican. She seemed;to know what he was thinking and to be thinking the same thing. Earle,,;too,, became aware of what was passing between them. Tod heard him curse;softly and saw him lean forward into the light and pick up a thick piece;of firewood.;;Mig laughed guiltily and began to sing.;;Las palmeras lloran por to ausencia,,;Las laguna se seco--ay!;La cerca de alambre que estaba en;El patio tambien se cayo!;;His voice was a plaintive tenor and it turned revolutionary song into a;sentimental lament,, sweet cloying. Faye joined in when he began another;stanza. She didn't know the words,, but she was able to carry melody and to;harmonize.;;Pues mi madre las cuidaba,, ay!;Toditito se acabo--ay!;;Their voices touched in the thin,, still air to form a minor chord and it;was as though their bodies had touched. The song was transformed again.;The melody remained the same,, but the rhythm broke and its beat became;ragged. It was a rumba now.;;Earle shifted uneasily and played with his stick. Tod saw her look at him;and saw that she was afraid,, but instead of becoming wary,, she grew still;more reckless. She took a long pull at the jug and stood up. She put one;hand on each of her buttocks and began to dance.;;Mig seemed to have completely forgotten Earle. He clapped his hands,,;cupping them to make a hollow,, drum-like sound,, and put all he felt into;his voice. He had changed to a more fitting song.;;Tony's wife,,;The boys in Havana love Tony's wife...;;Faye had her hands clasped behind her head now and she rolled her hips to;the broken beat. She was doing the bump.;;Tony's wife,,;They're fightin' their duels about Tony's wife...;;Perhaps Tod had been mistaken about Earle. He was using his club on the;back of the skillet,, using it to bang out the rhythm.;;The Mexican stood up,, still singing,, and joined her in the dance. They;approached each other with short mincing steps. She held her skirt up and;out with her thumbs and forefingers and he did the same with his;trousers. They met head on,, blue-black against pale gold,, and used their;heads to pivot,, then danced back to back with their buttocks touching,,;their knees bent and wide apart. While Faye shook her breasts and her;head,, holding the rest of her body rigid,, he struck the soft ground;heavily with his feet and circled her. They faced each other again and;made believe they were cradling their behinds in a shawl.;;Earle pounded the skillet harder and harder until it rang like an anvil.;Suddenly he,, too,, jumped up and began to dance. He did a crude hoe-down.;He leaped into the air and knocked his heels together. He whooped. But he;couldn't become part of their dance. Its rhythm was like a smooth glass;wall between him and the dancers. No matter how loudly he whooped or;threw himself around,, he was unable to disturb the precision with which;they retreated and advanced,, separated and came together again.;;Tod saw the blow before it fell.. He saw Earle raise his stick and bring;it down on the Mexican's head. He heard the crack and saw the Mexican go;to his knees still dancing,, his body unwilling or unable to acknowledge;the interruption.;;Faye had her back to Mig when he fell,, but she didn't turn to look. She;ran. She flashed by Tod. He reached for her ankle to pull her down,, but;missed. He scrambled to his feet and ran after her.;;If he caught her now,, she wouldn't escape. He could hear her on the hill;a little way ahead of him. He shouted to her,, a deep,, agonized bellow,,;like that a hound makes when it strikes a fresh line after hours of cold;trailing. Already he could feel how it would be when he pulled her to the;ground.;;But the going was heavy and the stones and sand moved under his feet. He;fell prone with his face in a clump of wild mustard that smelled of the;rain and sun,, clean,, fresh and sharp. He rolled over on his back and;stared up at the sky. The violent exercise had driven most of the heat;out of his blood,, but enough remained to make him tingle pleasantly. He;felt comfortably relaxed,, even happy.;;Somewhere farther up the hill a bird began to sing. He listened. At first;the low rich music sounded like water dripping on something hollow,, the;bottom of a silver pot perhaps,, then like a stick dragged slowly over the;strings of a harp. He lay quietly,, listening.;;When the bird grew silent,, he made an effort to put Faye out of his mind;and began to think about the series of cartoons he was making for his;canvas of Los Angeles on fire. He was going to show the city burning at;high noon,, so that the flames would have to compete with the desert sun;and thereby appear less fearful,, more like bright flags flying from roofs;and windows than a terrible holocaust. He wanted the city to have quite a;gala air as it burned,, to appear almost gay. And the people who set it on;fire would be a holiday crowd.;;The bird began to sing again. When it stopped,, Faye was forgotten and he;only wondered if he weren't exaggerating the importance of the people who;come to California to die. Maybe they weren't really desperate enough to;set 'a single city on fire,, let alone the whole country. Maybe they were;only the pick of America's madmen and not at all typical of the rest of;the land.;;He told himself that it didn't make any difference because he was an;artist,, not a prophet. His work would not be judged by the accuracy with;which it foretold a future event but by its merit as painting.;Nevertheless,, he refused to give up the role of Jeremiah. He changed;pick of America's madmen to cream and felt almost certain that the;milk from which it had been skimmed was just as rich in violence. The;Angelenos would be first,, but their comrades all over the country would;follow. There would be civil war.;;He was amused by the strong feeling of satisfaction this dire conclusion;gave him. Were all prophets of doom and destruction such happy men?;;He stood up without trying to answer. When he reached the dirt road at;the top of the canyon Faye and the car were gone.;;;15;;;She went to the pictures with that Simpson guy,, Harry told him when he;called to see her the next night.;;He sat down to wait for her. The old man was very ill and lay on the bed;with extreme care as though it were a narrow shelf from which he might;fall if he moved.;;What are they making on your lot? he asked slowly,, rolling his eyes;toward Tod without budging his head.;;'Manifest Destiny,,' 'Sweet and Low Down,,' 'Waterloo,,' The Great Divide,,';Begging Your...;;'The Great Divide'-- Harry said,, interrupting eagerly. I remember that;vehicle.;;Tod realized he shouldn't have got him started,, but there was nothing he;could do about it now. He had to let him run down like a clock.;;When it opened I was playing the Irving in a little number called 'Enter;Two Gents,,' a trifle,, but entertainment,, real entertainment. I played a;Jew comic,, a Ben Welch effect,, derby and big pants--'Pat,, dey hollered me;a chob in de Heagle Laundreh'...'Faith now,, Ikey,, and did you take;it?'...'No,, who vants to vash heagles?' Joe Parvos played straight for me;in a cop's suit. Well,, the night 'The Great Divide' opened,, Joe was;laying up with a whisker in the old Fifth Avenue when the stove exploded.;It was the broad's husband who blew the whistle. He was...;;He hadn't run down. He had stopped and was squeezing his left side with;both hands.;;Tod leaned over anxiously.;;Some water?;;Harry framed the word no with his lips,, then groaned skillfully. It was;a second-act curtain groan,, so phony that Tod had to hide a smile. And;yet,, the old man's pallor hadn't come from a box.;;Harry groaned again,, modulating from pain to exhaustion,, then closed his;eyes. Tod saw how skillfully he got the maximum effect out of his;agonized profile by using the pillow to set it off. He also noticed that;Harry,, like many actors,, had very little back or top to his head. It was;almost all face,, like a mask,, with deep furrows between the eyes,, across;the forehead and on either side of the nose and mouth,, plowed there by;years of broad grinning and heavy frowning. Because of them,, he could;never express anything either subtly or exactly. They wouldn't permit;degrees of feeling,, only the furthest degree.;;Tod began to wonder if it might not be true that actors suffer less than;other people. He thought about this for a while,, then decided that he was;wrong. Feeling is of the heart and nerves and the crudeness of its;expression has nothing to do with its intensity. Harry suffered as keenly;as anyone,, despite the theatricality of his groans and grimaces.;;He seemed to enjoy suffering. But not all kinds,, certainly not sickness.;Like many people,, he only enjoyed the sort that was self-inflicted. His;favorite method was to bare his soul to strangers in barrooms. He would;make believe he was drunk,, and stumble over to where some strangers were;sitting. He usually began by reciting a poem.;;Let me sit down for a moment,,;I have a stone in my shoe.;I was once blithe and happy,,;I was once young like you.;;If his audience shouted,, scram,, bum! he only smiled humbly and went on;with his act.;;Have pity,, folks,, on my gray hair...;;The bartender or someone else had to stop him by force,, otherwise he;would go on no matter what was said to him. Once he got started everyone;in the bar usually listened,, for he gave a great performance. He roared;and whispered,, commanded and cajoled. He imitated the whimper of a little;girl crying for her vanished mother,, as well as the different dialects of;the many cruel managers he had known. He even did the off-stage noises,,;twittering like birds to herald the dawn of Love and yelping like a pack;of bloodhounds when describing how an Evil Fate ever pursued him.;;He made his audience see him start out in his youth to play Shakespeare;in the auditorium of the Cambridge Latin School,, full of glorious dreams,,;burning with ambition. Follow him,, as still-a mere stripling,, he starved;in a Broadway rooming house,, an idealist who desired only to share his;art with the world. Stand with him,, as,, in the prime of manhood,, he;married a beautiful dancer,, a headliner on the Gus Sun time. Be close;behind him as,, one night,, he returned home unexpectedly to find her in;the arms of a head usher. Forgive,, as he forgave,, out of the goodness of;his heart and the greatness of his love. Then laugh,, tasting the bitter;gall,, when the very next night he found her in the arms of a booking;agent. Again he forgave her and again she sinned. Even then he didn't;cast her out,, no,, though she jeered,, mocked and even struck him;repeatedly with an umbrella. But she ran off with a foreigner,, a swarthy;magician fellow. Behind she left memories and their baby daughter. He;made his audience shadow him still as misfortune followed misfortune and,,;a middle-aged man,, he haunted the booking offices,, only a ghost of his;former self. He who had hoped to play Hamlet,, Lear,, Othello,, must needs;become the Co. in an act called Nat Plumstone &amp,; Co.,, light quips and;breezy patter. He made them dog his dragging feet as,, an aged and;trembling old man,, he...;;Faye came in quietly. Tod started to greet her,, but she put her finger to;her lips for him to be silent and motioned toward the bed.;;The old man was asleep. Tod thought his worn,, dry skin looked like eroded;ground. The few beads of sweat that glistened on his forehead and temples;carried no promise of relief. It might rot,, like rain that comes too late;to a field,, but could never refresh.;;They both tiptoed out of the room.;;In the hall he asked if she had had a good time with Homer.;;That dope! she exclaimed,, making a wry face. He's strictly;home-cooking.;;Tod started to ask some more questions,, but she dismissed him with a;curt,, I'm tired,, honey.;;;16;;;The next afternoon,, Tod was on his way upstairs when he saw a crowd in;front of the door to the Greeners' apartment. They were excited and;talked in whispers. What's happened? he asked.;;Harry's dead.;;He tried the door of the apartment. It wasn't locked,, so he went in. The;corpse lay stretched out on the bed,, completely covered with a blanket.;From Faye's room came the sound of crying. He knocked softly on her door.;She opened it for him,, then turned without saying a word,, and stumbled to;her bed. She was sobbing into a face towel.;;He stood in the doorway,, without knowing what to do or say. Finally,, he;went over to the bed and tried to comfort her. He patted her shoulder.;;You poor kid.;;She was wearing a tattered,, black lace negligee that had large rents in;it. When he leaned over her,, he noticed that her skin gave off a warm,,;sweet odor,, like that of buck-wheat in flower.;;He turned away and lit a cigarette. There was a knock on the door. When;he opened it,, Mary Dove rushed past him to take Faye in her arms.;;Mary also told Faye to be brave. She phrased it differently than he had;done,, however,, and made it sound a lot more convincing.;;Show some guts,, kid. Come on now,, show some guts.;;Faye shoved her away and stood up. She took a few wild steps,, then sat;down on the bed again.;;I killed him,, she groaned.;;Mary and he both denied this emphatically.;;I killed him,, I tell you! I did! I did!;;She began to call herself names. Mary wanted to stop her,, but Tod told;her not to. Faye had begun to act and he felt that if they didn't;interfere she would manage an escape for herself.;;She'll talk herself quiet,, he said.;;In a voice heavy with self-accusation,, she began to tell what had;happened. She had come home from the studio and found Harry in bed. She;asked him how he was,, but didn't wait for an answer. Instead,, she turned;her back on him to examine herself in the wall mirror. While fixing her;face,, she told him that she had seen Ben Murphy and that Ben had said if;Harry were feeling better he might be able to use him in a Bowery;sequence. She had been surprised when he didn't shout as he always did;when Ben's name was mentioned. He was jealous of Ben and always shouted,,;To hell with that bastard,; I knew him when he cleaned spittoons in a;nigger barroom.;;She realized that he must be pretty sick. She didn't turn around because;she noticed what looked like the beginning of a pimple. It was only a;speck of dirt and she wiped it off,, but then she had to do her face all;over again. While she was working at it,, she told him that she could get;a job as a dress extra if she had a new evening gown. Just to kid him,,;she looked tough and said,, If you can't buy me an evening gown,, I'll;find someone who can.;;When he didn't say anything,, she got sore and began to sing,, Jeepers;Creepers. He didn't tell her to shut up,, so she knew something must be;wrong. She ran over to the couch. He was dead.;;As soon as she had finished telling all this,, she began to sob in a lower;key,, almost a coo,, and rocked herself back and forth.;;Poor papa...Poor darling...;;The fun they used to have together when she was little. No matter how;hard up he was,, he always bought her dolls and candy,, and no matter how;tired,, he always played with her. She used to ride piggy-back and they;would roll on the floor and laugh and laugh.;;Mary's sobs made Faye speed up her own and they both began to get out of;hand.;;There was a knock on the door. Tod answered it and found Mrs. Johnson,,;the janitress. Faye shook her head for him not to let her in.;;Come back later,, Tod said.;;He shut the door in her face. A minute later it opened again and Mrs.;Johnson entered boldly. She had used a pass-key.;;Get out,, he said.;;She tried to push past him,, but he held her until Faye told him to let;her go.;;He disliked Mrs. Johnson intensely. She was an officious,, bustling woman;with a face like a baked apple,, soft and blotched. Later he found out;that her hobby was funerals. Her preoccupation with them wasn't morbid,;;it was formal. She was interested in the arrangement of the flowers,, the;order of the procession,, the clothing and deportment of the mourners.;;She went straight to Faye and stopped her sobs with a firm,, Now,, Miss;Greener.;;There was so much authority in her voice and manner that she succeeded;where Mary and Tod had failed. Faye looked up at her respectfully.;;First,, my dear,, Mrs. Johnson said,, counting one with the thumb of her;right hand on the index finger of her left,, first,, I want you to;understand that my sole desire in this matter is to help you.;;She looked hard at Mary,, then at Tod.;;I don't get anything out of it,, and it's just a lot of trouble.;;Yes,, Faye said.;;All right. There are several things I have to know,, if I'm to help you.;Did the deceased leave any money or insurance?;;No.;;Have you any money?;;No.;;Can you borrow any?;;I don't think so.;;Mrs. Johnson sighed.;;Then the city will have to bury him.;;Faye didn't comment.;;Don't you understand,, child,, the city will have to bury him in a;pauper's grave?;;She put so much contempt into city and horror into pauper that Faye;flushed and began to sob again.;;Mrs. Johnson made as though to walk out,, even took several steps in the;direction of the door,, then changed her mind and came back.;;How much does a funeral cost? Faye asked.;;Two hundred dollars. But you can pay on the installment plan--fifty;dollars down and twenty-five a month.;;Mary and Tod both spoke together.;;I'll get the money.;;I've got some.;;That's fine,, Mrs. Johnson said. You'll need at least fifty more for;incidental expenses. I'll go ahead and take care of everything. Mr.;Holsepp will bury your father. He'll do it right.;;She shook hands with Faye,, as though she were congratulating her,, and;hurried out of the room.;;Mrs. Johnson's little business talk had apparently done Faye some good.;Her lips were set and her eyes dry. Don't worry,, Tod said. I can raise;the money.;;No,, thanks,, she said.;;Mary opened her purse and took out a roll of bills. Here's some.;;No,, she said,, pushing it away.;;She sat thinking for a while,, then went to the dressing table and began;to fix her tear-stained face. She wore a hard smile as she worked.;Suddenly she turned,, lipstick in air,, and spoke to Mary.;;Can you get me into Mrs. Jenning's?;;What for? Tod demanded. I'll get the money. Both girls ignored him.;;Sure,, said Mary,, you ought to done that long ago. It's a soft touch.;;Faye laughed.;;I was saving it.;;The change that had come over both of them startled Tod. They had;suddenly become very tough.;;For a punkola like that Earle. Get smart,, girlie,, and lay off the;cheapies. Let him ride a horse,, he's a cowboy,, ain't he?;;They laughed shrilly and went into the bathroom with their arms around;each other.;;Tod thought he understood their sudden change to slang. It made them feel;worldly and realistic,, and so more able to cope with serious things.;;He knocked on the bathroom door.;;What do you want? Faye called out.;;Listen,, kid,, he said,, trying to imitate them. Why go on the turf? I;can get the dough.;;Oh,, yeah! No,, thanks,, Faye said.;;But listen... he began again.;;Go peddle your tripe! Mary shouted.;;;17;;;On the day of Harry's funeral Tod was drunk: He hadn't seen Faye since;she went off with Mary Dove,, but he knew that he was certain to find her;at the undertaking parlor and he wanted to have the courage to quarrel;with her. He started drinking at lunch. When he got to Holsepp's in the;late afternoon,, he had passed the brave state and was well into the ugly;one.;;He found Harry in his box,, waiting to be wheeled out for exhibition in;the adjoining chapel. The casket was open and the old man looked quite;snug. Drawn up to a little below his shoulders and folded back to show;its fancy lining was an ivory satin coverlet. Under his head was a tiny;lace cushion. He was wearing a Tuxedo,, or at least had on a black bow-tie;with his stiff shirt and wing collar. His face had been newly shaved,, his;eyebrows shaped and plucked and his lips and cheeks rouged. He looked;like the interlocutor in a minstrel show.;;Tod bowed his head as though in silent prayer when he heard someone come;in. He recognized Mrs. Johnson's voice and turned carefully to face her.;He caught her eye and nodded,, but she ignored him. She was busy with a;man in a badly fitting frock coat.;;It's the principle of the thing,, she scolded. Your estimate said;bronze. Those handles ain't bronze and you know it.;;But I asked Miss Greener,, whined the man. She okayed them.;;I don't care. I'm surprised at you,, trying to save a few dollars by;fobbing off a set of cheap gun-metal handles on the poor child.;;Tod didn't wait for the undertaker to answer. He had seen Faye pass the;door on the arm of one of the Lee sisters. When he caught up with her,, he;didn't know what to say. She misunderstood his agitation and was touched.;She sobbed a little for him.;;She had never looked more beautiful. She was wearing a new,, very tight;black dress and her platinum hair was tucked up in a shining bun under a;black straw sailor. Ever so often,, she carried a tiny lace handkerchief;to her eyes and made it flutter there for a moment. But all he could;think of was that she had earned the money for her outfit on her back.;;She grew uneasy under his stare and started to edge away. He caught her;arm.;;May I speak with you for a minute,, alone?;;Miss Lee took the hint and left.;;What is it? Faye asked.;;Not here,, he whispered,, making mystery out of his uncertainty,,;;He led her along the hall until he found an empty showroom. On the walls;were framed photographs of important funerals and on little stands and;tables were samples of coffin materials,, and models of tombstones and;mausoleums.;;Not knowing what to say,, he accented his awkwardness,, playing the;inoffensive fool.;;She smiled and became almost friendly.;;Give out,, you big dope.;;A kiss...;;Sure,, baby,, she laughed,, only don't muss me. They pecked at each;other.;;She tried to get away,, but he held her. She became annoyed and demanded;an explanation. He searched his head for one. It wasn't his head he;should have searched,, however.;;She was leaning toward him,, drooping slightly,, but not from fatigue. He;had seen young birches droop like that at midday when-they are over-heavy;with sun.;;You're drunk,, she said,, pushing him away.;;Please,, he begged.;;Le'go,, you bastard.;;Raging at him,, she was still beautiful. That was because her beauty was;structural like a tree's,, not a quality of her mind or heart. Perhaps;even whoring couldn't damage it for that reason,, only age or accident or;disease.;;In a minute she would scream for help. He had to say something. She;wouldn't understand the aesthetic argument and with what values could he;back up the moral one? The economic didn't make sense either. Whoring;certainly paid. Half of the customer's thirty dollars. Say ten men a;week.;;She kicked at his shins,, but he held on to her. Suddenly he began to;talk. He had found an argument. Disease would destroy her beauty. He;shouted at her like a Y.M.C.A. lecturer on sex hygiene.;;She stopped struggling and held her head down,, sobbing fitfully. When he;was through,, he let go of her arms and she bolted from the room. He;groped his way to a carved,, marble coffin.;;He was still sitting there when a young man in a black jacket and gray;striped trousers came in.;;Are you here for the Greener funeral?;;Tod stood up and nodded vaguely.;;The services are beginning,, the man said,, then opened a little casket;covered with grosgrain satin and took out a dust cloth. Tod watched him;go around the showroom wiping off the samples.;;Services have probably started,, the man repeated with a wave at the;door.;;Tod understood this time and left. The only exit he could find led;through the chapel. The moment he entered it,, Mrs. Johnson caught him and;directed him to a seat. He wanted badly to get away,, but it was;impossible to do so without making a scene.;;Faye was sitting in the front row of benches,, facing the pulpit. She had;the Lee sisters on one side and Mary Dove and Abe Kusich on the other.;Behind them sat the tenants of the San Berdoo,, occupying about six rows.;Tod was alone in the seventh. After him were several empty rows and then;a scattering of men and women who looked very much out of place.;;He turned in order not to see Faye's jerking shoulders and examined the;people in the last rows. He knew their kind. While not torch-bearers;themselves,, they would run behind the fire and do a great deal of the;shouting. They had come to see Harry buried,, hoping for a dramatic;incident of some sort,, hoping at least for one of the mourners to be led;weeping hysterically from the chapel. It seemed to Tod that they stared;back at him with an expression of vicious,, acrid boredom that trembled on;the edge of violence. When they began to mutter among themselves,, he;half-turned and watched them out of the corner of his eyes.;;An old woman with a face pulled out of shape by badly-fitting store teeth;came in and whispered to a man sucking on the handle of a home-made;walking stick. He passed her message along and they all stood up and went;out hurriedly. Tod guessed that some star had been seen going into a;restaurant by one of their scouts. If so,, they would wait outside the;place for hours until the star came out again or the police drove them;away.;;The Gingo family arrived soon after they had left. The Gingos were;Eskimos who had been brought to Hollywood to make retakes for a picture;about polar exploration. Although it had been released long ago,, they;refused to return to Alaska. They liked Hollywood.;;Harry had been a good friend of theirs and had eaten with them quite;regularly,, sharing the smoked salmon,, white fish,, marinated and maatjes;herrings they bought at Jewish delicatessen stores. He also shared the;great quantities of cheap brandy they mixed with hot water and salt;butter and drank out of tin cups.;;Mama and Papa Gingo,, trailed by their son,, moved down the center aisle of;the chapel,, bowing and waving to everyone,, until they reached the front;row. Here they gathered around Faye and shook hands with her,, each one in;turn. Mrs. Johnson tried to make them go to one of the back rows,, but;they ignored her orders and sat down in front.;;The overhead lights of the chapel were suddenly dimmed. Simultaneously;other lights went on behind imitation stained-glass windows which hung on;the fake oak-paneled walls. There was a moment of hushed silence,, broken;only by Faye's sobs,, then an electric organ started to play a recording;of one of Bach's chorales,, Come Redeemer,, Our Saviour.;;Tod recognized the music. His mother often played a piano adaptation of;it on Sundays at home. It very politely asked Christ to come,, in clear;and honest tones with just the proper amount of supplication. The God it;invited was not the King of Kings,, but a shy and gentle Christ,, a maiden;surrounded by maidens,, and the invitation was to a lawn fete,, not to the;home of some weary,, suffering sinner. It didn't plead,; it urged with;infinite grace and delicacy,, almost as though it were afraid of;frightening the prospective guest.;;So far as Tod could tell,, no one was listening to the music. Faye was;sobbing and the others seemed busy inside themselves. Bach politely;serenading Christ was not for them.;;The music would soon change its tone and grow exciting. He wondered if;that would make any difference. Already the bass was beginning to throb.;He noticed that it made the Eskimos uneasy. As the bass gained in. power;and began to dominate the treble,, he heard Papa Gingo grunt with;pleasure. Mama caught Mrs. Johnson eyeing him,, and put her fat hand on;the back of his head to keep him quiet.;;Now come,, 0 our Saviour,, the music begged. Gone was its diffidence and;no longer was it polite. Its struggle with the bass had changed it. Even;a hint of a threat crept in and a little impatience. Of doubt,, however,,;he could not detect the slightest trace.;;If there was a hint of a threat,, he thought,, just a hint,, and a tiny bit;of impatience,, could Bach be blamed? After all,, when he wrote this music,,;the world had already been waiting for its lover more than seventeen;hundred years. But the music changed again and both threat and impatience;disappeared. The treble soared free and triumphant and the bass no longer;struggled to keep it down. It had become a rich accompaniment. Come or;don't come,, the music seemed to say,, I love you and my love is enough.;It was a simple statement of fact,, neither cry nor serenade,, made without;arrogance or humility.;;Perhaps Christ heard. If He did,, He gave no sign. The attendants heard,,;for it was their cue to trundle on Harry in his box. Mrs. Johnson;followed close behind and saw to it that the casket was properly placed.;She raised her hand and Bach was silenced in the middle of a phrase.;;Will those of you who wish to view the deceased before the sermon please;step forward? she called out.;;Only the Gingos stood up immediately. They made for the coffin in a;group. Mrs. Johnson held them back and motioned for Faye to look first.;Supported by Mary Dove and the Lee girls,, she took a quick peek,,;increased the tempo of her sobs for a moment,, then hurried back to the;bench.;;The Gingos had their chance next. They leaned over the coffin and told;each other something in a series of thick,, explosive gutturals. When they;tried to take another look,, Mrs. Johnson herded them firmly to their;seats.;;The dwarf sidled up to the box,, made a play with his handkerchief and;retreated. When no one followed him,, Mrs. Johnson lost patience,, seeming;to take what she understood as a lack of interest for a personal insult.;;Those who wish to view the remains of the late Mr. Greener must do so at;once,, she barked.;;There was a little stir,, but no one stood up.;;You,, Mrs. Gail,, she finally said,, looking directly at the person named.;How about you? Don't you want a last look? Soon all that remains of your;neighbor will be buried forever.;;There was no getting out of it. Mrs. Gail moved down the aisle,, trailed;by several others.;;Tod used them to cover his escape.;;;18;;;Faye moved out of the San Berdoo the day after the funeral. Tod didn't;know where she had gone and was getting up the courage to call Mrs.;Jenning when he saw her from the window of his office. She was dressed in;the costume of a Napoleonic vivandiere. By the time he got the window;open,, she had almost turned the corner of the building. He shouted for;her to wait. She waved,, but when he got downstairs she was gone.;;From her dress,, he was sure that she was working in the picture called;Waterloo. He asked a studio policeman where the company was shooting;and was told on the back lot. He started toward it at once. A platoon of;cuirassiers,, big men mounted on gigantic horses,, went by. He knew that;they must be headed for the same set and followed them. They broke into a;gallop and he was soon outdistanced.;;The sun was very hot. His eyes and throat were choked with the dust;thrown up by the horses' hooves and his head throbbed. The only bit of;shade he could find was under an ocean liner made of painted canvas with;real lifeboats hanging from its davits. He stood in its narrow shadow for;a while,, then went on toward a great forty-foot papier mach sphinx that;loomed up in the distance. He had to cross a desert to reach it,, a desert;that was continually being made larger by a fleet of trucks dumping white;sand. He had gone only a few feet when a man with a megaphone ordered him;off.;;He skirted the desert,, making a wide turn to the right,, and came to a;Western street with a plank sidewalk. On the porch of the Last Chance;Saloon was a rocking chair. He sat down on it and lit a cigarette.;;From there he could see a jungle compound with a water buffalo tethered;to the side of a conical grass hut. Every few seconds the animal groaned;musically. Suddenly an Arab charged by on a white stallion. He shouted at;the man,, but got no answer. A little while later he saw a truck with a;load of snow and several malamute dogs. He shouted again. The driver;shouted something back,, but didn't stop.;;Throwing away his cigarette,, he went through the swinging doors of the;saloon. There was no back to the building and he found himself in a Paris;street. He followed it to its end,, coming out in a Romanesque courtyard.;He heard voices a short distance away and went toward them. On a lawn of;fiber,, a group of men and women in riding costume were picnicking. They;were eating cardboard food in front of a cellophane waterfall. He started;toward them to ask his way,, but was stopped by a man who scowled and held;up a sign--Quiet,, Please,, We're Shooting. When Tod took another step;forward,, the man shook his fist threateningly.;;Next he came to a small pond with large celluloid swans floating on it.;Across one end was a bridge with a sign that read,, To Kamp Komfit. He;crossed the bridge and followed a little path that ended at a Greek;temple dedicated to Eros. The god himself lay face downward in a pile of;old newspapers and bottles.;;From the steps of the temple,, he could see in the distance a road lined;with Lombardy poplars. It was the one on which he had lost the;cuirassiers. He pushed his way through a tangle of briars,, old flats and;iron junk,, skirting the skeleton of a Zeppelin,, a bamboo stockade,, an;adobe fort,, the wooden horse of Troy,, a flight of baroque palace stairs;that started in a bed of weeds and ended against the branches of an oak,,;part of the Fourteenth Street elevated station,, a Dutch windmill,, the;bones of a dinosaur,, the upper half of the Merrimac,, a corner of a Mayan;temple,, until he finally reached the road.;;He was out of breath. He sat down under one of the poplars on a rock made;of brown plaster and took off his jacket. There was a cool breeze blowing;and he soon felt more comfortable.;;He had lately begun to think not only of Goya and Daumier but also of;certain Italian artists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,, of;Salvator Rosa,, Francesco Guardi and Monsu Desiderio,, the painters of;Decay and Mystery. Looking downhill now,, he could see compositions that;might have actually been arranged from the Calabrian work of Rosa. There;were partially demolished buildings and broken monuments,, half-hidden by;great,, tortured trees,, whose exposed roots writhed dramatically in the;arid ground,, and by shrubs that carried,, not flowers or berries,, but;armories of spikes,, hooks and swords.;;For Guardi and Desiderio there were bridges which bridged nothing,,;sculpture in trees,, palaces that seemed of marble until a whole stone;portico began to flap in the light breeze. And there were figures as;well. A hundred yards from where Tod was sitting a man in a derby hat;leaned drowsily against the gilded poop of a Venetian barque and peeled;an apple. Still farther on,, a charwoman on a stepladder was scrubbing;with soap and water the face of a Buddha thirty feet high.;;He left the road and climbed across the spine of the hill to look down on;the other side. From there he could see a ten-acre field of cockleburs;spotted with clumps of sunflowers and wild gum. In the center of the;field was a gigantic pile of sets,, flats and props. While he watched,, a;ten-ton truck added another load to it. This was the final dumping;ground. He thought of Janvier's Sargasso Sea. Just as that imaginary;body of water was a history of civilization in the form of a marine;junkyard,, the studio lot was one in the form of a dream dump. A Sargasso;of the imagination! And the dump grew continually,, for there wasn't a;dream afloat somewhere which wouldn't sooner or later turn up on it,,;having first been made photographic by plaster,, canvas,, lath and paint.;Many boats sink and never reach the Sargasso,, but no dream ever entirely;disappears. Somewhere it troubles some unfortunate person and some day,,;when that person has been sufficiently troubled,, it will be reproduced on;the lot.;;When he saw a red glare in the sky and heard the rumble of cannon,, he;knew it must be Waterloo. From around a bend in the road trotted several;cavalry regiments. They wore casques and chest armor of black cardboard;and carried long horse pistols in their saddle holsters. They were Victor;Hugo's soldiers. He had worked on some of the drawings for their uniforms;himself,, following carefully the descriptions in Les Miserables.;;He went in the direction they took. Before long he was passed by the men;of Lefebvre-Desnouttes,, followed by a regiment of gendarmes d'lite,,;several companies of chasseurs of the guard and a flying detachment of;Rimbaud's lancers.;;They must be moving up for the disastrous attack on La Haite Santee. He;hadn't read the scenario and wondered if it had rained yesterday. Would;Grouchy or Bulcher arrive? Grotenstein,, the producer,, might have changed;it.;;The sound of cannon was becoming louder all the time and the red fan in;the sky more intense. He could smell the sweet,, pungent odor of blank;powder. It might be over before he could get there. He started to run.;When he topped a rise after a sharp bend in the road,, he found a great;plain below him covered with early nineteenth-century troops,, wearing all;the gay and elaborate uniforms that used to please him so much when he;was a child and spent long hours looking at the soldiers in an old;dictionary. At the far end of the field,, he could see an enormous hump;around which the English and their allies were gathered. It was Mont St.;Jean and they were getting ready to defend it gallantly. It wasn't quite;finished,, however,, and swarmed with grips,, property men,, set dressers,,;carpenters and painters.;;Tod stood near a eucalyptus tree to watch,, concealing himself behind a;sign that read,, Waterloo'--A Charles H. Grotenstein Production. Nearby;a youth in a carefully torn horse guard's uniform was being rehearsed in;his lines by one of the assistant directors.;;Vive l'Empereur! the young man shouted,, then clutched his breast and;fell forward dead. The assistant director was a hard man to please and;made him do it over and over again.;;In the center of the plain,, the battle was going ahead briskly. Things;looked tough for the British and their allies. The Prince of Orange;commanding the center,, Hill the right and Picton the left wing,, were;being pressed hard by the veteran French. The desperate and intrepid;Prince was in an especially bad spot. Tod heard him cry hoarsely above;the din of battle,, shouting to the Hollande-Belgians,, Nassau! Brunswick!;Never retreat! Nevertheless,, the retreat began. Hill,, too,, fell back.;The French killed General Picton with a ball through the head and he;returned to his dressing room. Alten was put to the sword and also;retired. The colors of the Lunenberg battalion,, borne by a prince of the;family of Deux-Ponts,, were captured by a famous child star in the uniform;of a Parisian drummer boy. The Scotch Greys were destroyed and went to;change into another uniform. Ponsonby's heavy dragoons were also cut to;ribbons. Mr. Grotenstein would have a large bill to pay at the Western;Costume Company.;;Neither Napoleon nor Wellington was to be seen. In Wellington's absence,,;one of the assistant directors,, a Mr. Crane,, was in command of the;allies. He reinforced his center with one of Chasse's brigades and one of;Wincke's. He supported these with infantry from Brunswick,, Welsh foot,,;Devon yeomanry and Hanoverian light horse with oblong leather caps and;flowing plumes of horsehair.;;For the French,, a man in a checked cap ordered Milhaud's cuirassiers to;carry Mont St. jean. With their sabers in their teeth and their pistols;in their hands,, they charged. It was a fearful sight.;;The man in the checked cap was making a fatal error. Mont St. Jean was;unfinished. The paint was not yet dry and all the struts were not in;place. Because of the thickness of the cannon smoke,, he had failed to see;that the hill was still being worked on by property men,, grips and;carpenters.;;It was the classic mistake,, Tod realized,, the same one Napoleon had made.;Then it had been wrong for a different reason. The Emperor had ordered;the cuirassiers to charge Mont St. Jean not knowing that a deep ditch was;hidden at its foot to trap his heavy cavalry. The result had been;disaster for the French,; the beginning of the end.;;This time the same mistake had a different outcome. Waterloo,, instead of;being the end of the Grand Army,, resulted in a draw. Neither side won,,;and it would have to be fought over again the next day. Big losses,,;however,, were sustained by the insurance company in workmen's;compensation. The man in the checked cap was sent to the dog house by Mr.;Grotenstein just as Napoleon was sent to St. Helena.;;When the front rank of Milhaud's heavy division started up the slope of;Mont St. Jean,, the hill collapsed. The noise was terrific. Nails screamed;with agony as they pulled out of joists. The sound of ripping canvas was;like that of little children whimpering. Lath and scantling snapped as;though they were brittle bones. The whole hill folded like an enormous;umbrella and covered Napoleon's army with painted cloth.;;It turned into a route. The victors of Bersina,, Leipsic,, Austerlitz,, fled;like schoolboys who had broken a pane of glass. Sauve qui peut! they;cried,, or,, rather,, Scram!;;The armies of England and her allies were too deep in scenery to flee.;They had to wait for the carpenters and ambulances to come up. The men of;the gallant Seventy-Fifth Highlanders were lifted out of the wreck with;block and tackle. They were carted off by the stretcher-bearers,, still;clinging bravely to their claymores.;;;19;;;Tod got a lift back to his office in a studio car. He had to ride on the;running board because the seats were occupied by two Walloon grenadiers;and four Swabian foot. One of the infantrymen had a broken leg,, the other;extras were only scratched and bruised. They were quite happy about their;wounds. They were certain to receive several extra days' pay,, and the man;with the broken leg thought he might get as much as five hundred dollars.;;When Tod arrived at his office,, he found Faye waiting to see him. She;hadn't been in the battle. At the last moment,, the director bad decided;not to use any vivandieres.;;To his surprise,, she greeted him with warm friendliness. Nevertheless,, he;tried to apologize for his behavior in the funeral parlor. He had hardly;started before she interrupted him. She wasn't angry,, but grateful for;his lecture on venereal disease. It had brought her to her senses.;;She had still another surprise for him. She was living in Homer Simpson's;house. The arrangement was a business one. Homer had agreed to board and;dress her until she became a star. They were keeping a record of every;cent he spent and as soon as she clicked in pictures,, she would pay him;back with six per cent interest. To make it absolutely legal,, they were;going to have a lawyer draw up a contract.;;She pressed Tod for an opinion and he said it was a splendid idea. She;thanked him and invited him to dinner for the next night.;;After she had gone,, he wondered what living with her would do to Homer.;He thought it might straighten him out. He fooled himself into believing;this with an image,, as though a man were a piece of iron to be heated and;then straightened with hammer blows. He should have known better,, for if;anyone ever lacked malleability Homer did.;;He continued to make this mistake when he had dinner with them. Faye;seemed very happy,, talking about charge accounts and stupid sales;clerks. Homer had a flower in his buttonhole,, wore carpet slippers and;beamed at her continually.;;After they had eaten,, while Homer was in the kitchen washing dishes,, Tod;got her to tell him what they did with themselves all day. She said that;they lived quietly and that she was glad because she was tired of;excitement. All she wanted was a career. Homer did the housework and she;was getting a real rest. Daddy's long sickness had tired her out;completely. Homer liked to do housework and anyway he wouldn't let her go;into the kitchen because of her hands.;;Protecting his investment,, Tod said.;;Yes,, she replied seriously,, they have to be beautiful. They had;breakfast around ten,, she went on. Homer brought it to her in bed. He;took a housekeeping magazine and fixed the tray like the pictures in it.;While she bathed and dressed,, he cleaned the house. Then they went;downtown to the stores and she bought all sorts of things,, mostly;clothes. They didn't eat lunch on account of her figure,, but usually had;dinner out and went to the movies. Then,, ice cream sodas,, Homer;finished for her,, as he came out of the kitchen.;;Faye laughed and excused herself. They were going to a picture and she;wanted to change her dress. When she had left,, Homer suggested that they;get some air in the patio. He made Tod take the deck chair while he sat;on an upturned orange crate.;;If he had been careful and had acted decently,, Tod couldn't help;thinking,, she might be living with him. He was at least better looking;than Homer. But then there was her other prerequisite. Homer had an;income and lived in a house,, while he earned thirty dollars a week and;lived in a furnished room.;;The happy grin on Homer's face made him feel ashamed of himself. He was;being unfair. Homer was a humble,, grateful man who would never laugh at;her,, who was incapable of laughing at anything. Because of this great;quality,, she could live with him on what she considered a much higher;plane.;;What's the matter? Homer asked softly,, laying one of his heavy hands on;Tod's knee.;;Nothing. Why?;;Tod moved so that the hand slipped off.;;You were making faces.;;I was thinking of something.;;Oh,, Homer said sympathetically.;;Tod couldn't resist asking an ugly question.;;When are you two getting married?;;Homer looked hurt.;;Didn't Faye tell about us?;;Yes,, sort of.;;It's a business arrangement.;;Yes?;;To make Tod believe it,, he poured out a long,, disjointed argument,, the;one he must have used on himself. He even went further than the business;part and claimed that they were doing it for poor Harry's sake. Faye had;nothing left in the world except her career and she must succeed for her;daddy's sake. The-reason she wasn't a star was because she didn't have;the right clothes. He had money and believed in her talent,, so it was;only natural for them to enter into a business arrangement. Did Tod know;a good lawyer?;;It was a rhetorical question,, but would become a real one,, painfully;insistent,, if Tod smiled. He frowned. That was wrong,, too.;;We must see a lawyer this week and have papers drawn up.;;His eagerness was pathetic. Tod wanted to help him,, but didn't know what;to say. He was still fumbling for answer when they heard a woman;shouting from the behind the garage.;;Adore! Adore!;;She had a high soprano voice,, very clear and pure.;;What a funny name,, Tod said,, glad to change the subject;;Maybe it's a foreigner,, Homer said.;;The woman came into the yard from around the corner of the garage.;She was eager and plump and very American.;;Have you seen my little boy? she asked,, making a gesture of;helplessness. Adore's such a wanderer.;;Homer surprised Tod by standing up and smiling at the woman. Faye had;certainly helped his timidity.;;Is your son lost? Homer said.;;Oh,, no--just hiding to tease me.;;She held out her hand.;;We're neighbors. I'm Maybelle Loomis.;;Glad to know you,, ma'am. I'm Homer Simpson and this is Mr. Hackett.;;Tod also shook hands with her.;;Have you been living here long? she asked. No. I've just come from the;East,, Homer said.;;Oh,, have you? I've been here ever since Mr. Loomis passed on six years;ago. I'm an old settler.;;You like it then? Tod asked.;;Like California? she laughed at the idea that anyone might not like it.;Why,, it's a paradise on earth!;;Yes,, Homer agreed gravely.;;And anyway,, she went on,, I have to live here on account of Adore.;;Is he sick?;;Oh,, no. On account of his career. His agent calls him the biggest little;attraction in Hollywood.;;She spoke so vehemently that Homer flinched.;;He's in the movies? Tod asked.;;I'll say,, she snapped.;;Homer tried to placate her,,;;That's very nice.;;If it weren't for favoritism,, she said bitterly,, he'd be a star. It;ain't talent. It's pull. What's Shirley Temple got that he ain't got?;;Why,, I don't know,, Homer mumbled.;;She ignored this and let out a fearful bellow.;;Adore! Adore!;;Tod had seen her kind around the studio. She was one of that army of;women who drag their children from casting office to casting office and;sit for hours,, weeks,, months,, waiting for a chance to show what Junior;can do. Some of them are very poor,, but no matter how poor,, they always;manage to scrape together enough money,, often by making great sacrifices,,;to send their children to one of the innumerable talent schools.;;Adore! she yelled once more,, then laughed and became a friendly;housewife again,, a chubby little person with dimples in her fat cheeks;and fat elbows.;;Have you any children,, Mr. Simpson? she asked.;;No,, he replied,, blushing.;;You're lucky--they're a nuisance.;;She laughed to show that she didn't really mean it and called her;child again.;;Adore ... Oh,, Adore...;;Her next question surprised them both.;;Who do you follow?;;What? said Tod.;;I mean--in the Search for Health,, along the Road of Life?;;They both gaped at her.;;I'm a raw-foodist,, myself,, she said. Dr. Pierce is our leader. You;must have seen his ads--'Know-All Pierce-All.';;Oh,, yes,, Tod said,, you're vegetarians. She laughed at his ignorance.;;Far from it. We're much stricter. Vegetarians eat cooked vegetables. We;eat only raw ones. Death comes from eating dead things.;;Neither Tod nor Homer found anything to say. Adore,, she began again.;Adore...;;This time there was an answer from around the corner of the garage.;;Here I am,, mama.;;A minute later,, a little boy appeared dragging behind him a small;sailboat on wheels. He was about eight years old,, with a pale,, peaked;face and a large,, troubled forehead. He had great staring eyes. His;eyebrows had been plucked and shaped carefully. Except for his Buster;Brown collar,, he was dressed like a man,, in long trousers,, vest and;jacket.;;He tried to kiss his mother,, but she fended him off and pulled at his;clothes,, straightening and arranging them with savage little tugs.;;Adore,, she said sternly,, I want you to meet Mr. Simpson,, our;neighbor.;;Turning like a soldier at the command of a drill sergeant,, he walked up;to Homer and grasped his hand.;;A pleasure,, sir,, he said,, bowing stiffly with his heels together.;;That's the way they do it in Europe,, Mrs. Loomis beamed. Isn't he;cuter;;What a pretty sailboat! Homer said,, trying to be friendly.;;Both mother and son ignored his comment. She pointed to Tod,, and the;child repeated his bow and heel-click. Well,, we've got to go,, she said.;;Tod watched the child,, who was standing a little to one side of his;mother and making faces at Homer. He rolled his eyes back in his head so;that only the whites showed and twisted his lips in a snarl.;;Mrs. Loomis noticed Tod's glance and turned sharply. When she saw what;Adore was doing,, she yanked him by the arm,, jerking him clear off the;ground.;;Adore! she yelled.;;To Tod she said apologetically,, He thinks he's the Frankenstein;monster.;;She picked the boy up,, hugging and kissing him ardently. Then she set him;down again and fixed his rumpled clothing.;;Won't Adore sing something for us? Tod asked. No,, the little boy said;sharply.;;Adore,, his mother scolded,, sing at once.;;That's all right,, if he doesn't feel like it,, Homer said. But Mrs.;Loomis was determined to have him sing. She could never permit him to;refuse an audience.;;Sing,, Adore,, she repeated with quiet menace. Sing 'Mama Doan Wan' No;Peas.';;His shoulders twitched as though they already felt the strap. He tilted;his straw sailor over one eye,, buttoned up his jacket and did a little;strut,, then began:;;Mama doan wan' no peas,,;An' rice,, an' cocoanut oil,,;Just a bottle of brandy handy all the day.;Mama doan wan' no peas,,;Mama doan wan' no cocoanut oil.;;His singing voice was deep and rough and he used the broken groan of the;blues singer quite expertly. He moved his body only a little,, against;rather than in time with the music. The gestures he made with his hands;were extremely suggestive.;;Mama doan wan't no gin,,;Because gin do make her sin,,;Mama doan wan' no glass of gin,,;Because it boun' to make her sin,,;An' keep her hot and bothered all the day.;;He seemed to know what the words meant,, or at least his body and his;voice seemed to know. When he came to the final chorus,, his buttocks;writhed and his voice carried a top-heavy load of sexual pain.;;Tod and Homer applauded. Adore grabbed the string of his sailboat and;circled the yard. He was imitating a tugboat. He tooted several times,,;then ran off.;;He's just a baby,, Mrs. Loomis said proudly,, but he's got loads of;talent.;;Tod and Homer agreed.;;She saw that he was gone again and left hurriedly. They could hear her;calling in the brush back of the garage. Adore! Adore...;;That's a funny woman,, Tod said.;;Homer sighed.;;I guess it's hard to get a start in pictures. But Faye is awfully;pretty.;;Tod agreed. She appeared a moment later in a new flower print dress and;picture hat and it was his turn to sigh. She was much more than pretty.;She posed,, quivering and balanced,, on the doorstep and looked down at the;two men in the patio. She was smiling,, a subtle half-smile uncontaminated;by thought. She looked just born,, everything moist and fresh,, volatile;and perfumed. Tod suddenly became very conscious of his dull,, insensitive;feet bound in dead skin and of his hands,, sticky and thick,, holding a;heavy,, rough felt hat.;;He tried to get out of going to the pictures with them,, but couldn't.;Sitting next to her in the dark proved the ordeal he expected it to be.;Her self-sufficiency made him squirm and the desire to break its smooth;surface with a blow,, or at least a sudden obscene gesture,, became;irresistible.;;He began to wonder if he himself didn't suffer from the ingrained,, morbid;apathy he liked to draw in others. Maybe he could only be galvanized into;sensibility and that was why he was chasing Faye.;;He left hurriedly,, without saying good-bye. He had decided to stop;running after her. It was an easy decision to make,, but a hard one to;carry out. In order to manage it,, he fell back on one of the oldest;tricks in the very full bag of the intellectual. After all,, he told;himself,, he had drawn her enough times. He shut the portfolio that held;the drawings he had made of her,, tied it with a string,, and put it away;in his trunk.;;It was a childish trick,, hardly-worthy of a primitive witch doctor,, yet;it worked. He was able to avoid her for several months. During this;time,, he took his pad and pencils on a continuous hunt for other models.;He spent his nights at the different Hollywood churches,, drawing the;worshipers. He visited the Church of Christ,, Physical where holiness;was attained through the constant use of chestweights and spring grips,;;the Church Invisible where fortunes were told and the dead made to;find lost objects,; the Tabernacle of the Third Coming where a woman in;male clothing preached the Crusade Against Salt,; and the Temple;Moderne under whose glass and chromium roof Brain-Breathing,, the;Secret of the Aztecs was taught.;;As he watched these people writhe on the hard seats of their churches,, he;thought of how well Alessandro Magnasco would dramatize the contrast;between their drained-out,, feeble bodies and their wild,, disordered,,;minds. He would not satirize them as Hogarth or Daumier might,, nor would;he pity them. He would paint their fury with respect,, appreciating its;awful,, anarchic power and aware that they had it in them to destroy;civilization.;;One Friday night in the Tabernacle of the Third Coming,, a man near Tod;stood up to speak. Although his name most likely was Thompson or Johnson;and his home town Sioux City,, he had the same countersunk eyes,, like the;heads of burnished spikes,, that a monk by Magnasco might have. He was;probably just in from one of the colonies in the desert near Soboba Hot;Springs where he had been conning over his soul on a diet of raw fruit;and nuts. He was very angry. The message he had brought to the city was;one that an illiterate anchorite might have given decadent Rome. It was a;crazy jumble of dietary rules,, economics and Biblical threats. He claimed;to have seen the Tiger of Wrath stalking the walls of the citadel and the;Jackal of Lust skulking in the shrubbery,, and he connected these omens;with thirty dollars every Thursday and meat eating.;;Tod didn't laugh at the man's rhetoric. He knew it was unimportant. What;mattered were his messianic rage and the emotional response of his;hearers. They sprang to their feet,, shaking their fists and shouting. On;the altar someone began to beat a bass drum and soon the entire;congregation was singing Onward Christian Soldiers.;;;20;;;As time went on,, the relationship between Faye and Homer began to change.;She became bored with the life they were leading together and as her;boredom deepened,, she began to persecute him. At first she did it;unconsciously,, later maliciously.;;Homer realized that the end was in sight even before she did. All he;could do to prevent its coming was to increase his servility and his;generosity. He waited on her hand and foot. He bought her a coat of;summer ermine and a light blue Buick runabout.;;His servility was like that of a cringing,, clumsy dog,, who is always;anticipating a blow,, welcoming it even,, and in a way that makes;overwhelming the desire to strike him. His generosity was still more;irritating. It was so helpless and unselfish that it made her feel mean;and cruel,, no matter how hard she tried to be kind. And it was so bulky;that she was unable to ignore it. She had to resent it. He was destroying;himself,, and although he didn't mean it that way,, forcing her to accept;the blame.;;They had almost reached a final crisis when Tod saw them again. Late one;night,, just as he was preparing for bed,, Homer knocked on his door and;said that Faye was downstairs in the car and that they wanted him to go;to a night club with them.;;The outfit Homer wore was very funny. He had on loose blue linen slacks;and a chocolate flannel jacket over a yellow polo shirt. Only a Negro;could have worn it without looking ridiculous,, and no one was ever less a;Negro than Homer.;;Tod drove with them to the Cinderella Bar,, a little stucco building in;the shape of a lady's slipper,, on Western Avenue. Its floor show;consisted of female impersonators.;;Faye was in a nasty mood. When the waiter took their order,, she insisted;on a champagne cocktail for Homer. He wanted coffee. The waiter brought;both,, but she made him take the coffee back.;;Homer explained painstakingly,, as he must have done many times,, that he;could not drink alcohol because it made him sick. Faye listened with mock;patience. When he finished,, she laughed and lifted the cocktail to his;mouth.;;Drink it,, damn you,, she said.;;She tilted the glass,, but he 'didn't open his mouth and the liquor ran;down his chin. He wiped himself,, using the napkin without unfolding it.;;Faye called the waiter again.;;He doesn't like champagne cocktails,, she said. Bring him brandy.;;Homer shook his head.;;Please,, Faye,, he whimpered.;;She held the brandy to his lips,, moving the glass when he turned away.;;Come on,, sport--bottoms up.;;Let him alone,, Tod finally said.;;She ignored him as though she hadn't even heard his protest. She was both;furious and ashamed of herself. Her shame strengthened her fury and gave;it a target.;;Come on,, sport,, she said savagely,, or mama'll spank. She turned to;Tod.;;I don't like people who won't drink. It isn't sociable. They feel;superior and I don't like people who feel superior.;;I don't feel superior,, Homer said.;;Oh,, yes,, you do. I'm drunk and you're sober and so you feel superior.;Goddamned,, stinking superior. He opened his mouth to reply and she;poured the brandy into it,, then clapped her hand over his lips so that he;couldn't spit it back. Some of it came out of his nose.;;Still without unfolding the napkin,, he wiped himself. Faye ordered;another brandy. When it came,, she held it to his lips again,, but this;time he took it and drink it himself,, fighting the stuff down.;;That's the boy,, Faye laughed. Well done,, sloppy-boppy.;;Tod asked her to dance in order to give Homer a moment alone. When they;reached the floor,, she made an attempt to defend herself.;;That guy's superiority is driving me crazy.;;He loves you,, Tod said.;;Yeah,, I know,, but he's such a slob.;;She started to cry on his shoulder and he held her very tight. He took a;long chance.;;Sleep with me.;;No,, baby,, she said sympathetically.;;Please,, please...just once.;;I can't,, honey. I don't love you.;;You worked for Mrs. Jenning. Make believe you're still working for her.;;She didn't get angry.;;That was a mistake. And anyway,, that was different. I only went on call;enough times to pay for the funeral and besides those men were complete;strangers. You know what I mean?;;Yes. But please,, darling. I'll never bother you again. I'll go east;right after. Be kind.;;I can't.;;Why...?;;I just can't. I'm sorry,, darling. I'm not a tease,, but I can't like;that.;;I love you.;;No,, sweetheart,, I can't.;;They danced until the number finished without saying anything else. He;was grateful to her for having behaved so well,, for not having made him;feel too ridiculous.;;When they returned to the table,, Homer was sitting exactly as they had;left him. He held the folded napkin in one hand and the empty brandy;glass in the other. His helplessness was extremely irritating.;;You're right about the brandy,, Faye,, Homer said. It's swell! Whoopee!;;He made a little circular gesture with the hand that held the glass.;;I'd like a Scotch,, Tod said.;;Me,, too,, Faye said.;;Homer made another gallant attempt to get into the spirit of the evening.;;Garsoon,, he called to the waiter,, more drinks.;;He grinned at them anxiously. Faye burst out laughing and Homer did his;best to laugh with her. When she stopped suddenly,, he found himself;laughing alone and turned his laugh into a cough,, then hid the cough in;his napkin.;;She turned to Tod.;;What the devil can you do with a slob like that?;;The orchestra started and Tod was able to ignore her question. All three;of them turned to watch a young man in a tight evening gown of red silk;sing a lullaby.;;Little man,, you're crying,,;I know why you're blue,,;Someone took your kiddycar away,;;Better go to sleep now,,;Little man,, you've had a busy day...;;He had a soft,, throbbing voice and his gestures were matronly,, tender and;aborted,, a series of unconscious caresses. What he was doing was in no;sense parody,; it was too simple and too restrained. It wasn't even;theatrical. This dark young man with his thin,, hairless arms and soft,,;rounded shoulders,, who rocked an imaginary cradle as he crooned,, was;really a woman.;;When he had finished,, there was a great deal of applause. The young man;shook himself and became an actor again. He tripped on his train,, as;though he weren't used to it,, lifted his skirts to show he was wearing;Paris garters,, then strode off swinging his shoulders. His imitation of a;man was awkward and obscene.;;Homer and Tod applauded him.;;I hate fairies,, Faye said.;;All women do.;;Tod meant it as a joke,, but Faye was angry.;;They're dirty,, she said.;;He started to say something else,, but Faye had turned to Homer again. She;seemed unable to resist nagging him.;;This time she pinched his arm until he gave a little squeak. Do you know;what a fairy is? she demanded.;;Yes,, he said hesitatingly.;;All right,, then,, she barked. Give out! What's a fairy? Homer twisted;uneasily,, as though he already felt the ruler on his behind,, and looked;imploring at Tod,, who tried to help him by forming the word homo with;his lips.;;Morro,, Homer said.;;Faye burst out laughing. But his hurt look made it impossible not to;relent,, so she patted his shoulder.;;What a hick,, she said.;;He grinned gratefully and signaled the waiter to bring another round of;drinks.;;The orchestra began to play and a man came over to ask Faye to dance.;Without saying a word to Homer,, she followed him to the floor.;;Who's that? Homer asked,, chasing them with his eyes.;;Tod made believe he knew and said that he had often seen him around the;San Berdoo. His explanation satisfied Homer,, but at the same time set him;to thinking of something else. Tod could almost see him shaping a;question in his head.;;Do you know Earle Shoop? Homer finally asked. Yes.;;Homer then poured out a long,, confused story about a dirty black hen. He;kept referring to the hen again and again,, as though it were the one;thing he couldn't stand about Earle and the Mexican. For a man who was;incapable of hatred,, he managed to draw a pretty horrible picture of the;bird.;;You never saw such a disgusting thing,, the way it squats and turns its;head. The roosters have torn all the feathers off its neck and made its;comb all bloody and it has scabby feet covered with warts and it cackles;so nasty when they drop it into the pen.;;Who drops it into what pen?';;The Mexican.;;Miguel?;;Yes. He's almost as bad as his hen.';;You've been to their camp?;;Camp?;;In the mountains?;;No. They're living in the garage. Faye asked me if I minded if a friend;of hers lived in the garage for a while because he was broke. But I;didn't know about the chickens or the Mexican...Lots of people are out of;work nowadays.;;Why don't you throw them out?;;They're broke and they have no place to go. It isn't very comfortable;living in a garage.;;But if they don't behave?;;It's just that hen. I don't mind the roosters,, they're pretty,, but that;dirty hen. She shakes her dirty feathers each time and clucks so nasty.;;You don't have to look at it.;;They do it every afternoon at the same time when I'm usually sitting in;the chair in the sun after I get back from shopping with Faye and just;before dinner The Mexican knows I don't like to see it so he tries to;make me look just for spite. I go into the house,, but he taps on the;windows and calls me to come out and watch. I don't call that fun. Some;people have funny ideas of what's fun.;;What's Faye say?;;She doesn't mind the hen. She says it's only natural.;;Then,, in case Tod should mistake this for criticism,, he told him what a;fine,, wholesome child she was. Tod agreed,, but brought him back to the;subject.;;If I were you,, he said,, I'd report the chickens to the police. You;have to have a permit to keep chickens in the city. I'd do something and;damned quick.;;Homer avoided a direct answer.;;I wouldn't touch that thing for all the money in the world. She's all;over scabs and almost naked. She looks like a buzzard. She eats meat. I;saw her one time eating some meat that the Mexican got out of the garbage;can. He feeds the roosters grain but the hen eats garbage and he keeps;her in a dirty box.;;If I were you,, rd throw those bastards out and their birds with them.;;No,, they're nice enough young fellows,, just down on their luck,, like a;lot of people these days,, you know. It's just that hen...;;He shook his head wearily,, as though he could smell and taste her.;;Faye was coming back. Homer saw that Tod was going to speak to her about;Earle and the Mexican and signaled desperately for him not to do it. She,,;however,, caught him at it and was curious.;;What have you guys been chinning about?;;You,, darling,, Tod said. Homer has a t.l. for you.;;Tell me,, Homer.;;No,, first you tell me one.;;Well,, the man I just danced with asked me if you were a movie big shot.;;Tod saw that Homer was unable to think of a return compliment so he spoke;for him.;;I said you were the most beautiful girl in the place.;;Yes,, Homer agreed. That's what Tod said.;;I don't believe it. Tod hates me. And anyway,, I caught you telling him;to keep quiet. You were shushing him. She laughed.;;I bet I know what you were talking about. She mimicked Homer's excited;disgust. 'That dirty black hen,, she's all over scabs and almost naked.';;Homer laughed apologetically,, but Tod was angry. What's the idea of;keeping those guys in the garage? he demanded.;;What the hell is it your business? she replied,, but not with real;anger. She was amused.;;Homer enjoys their company. Don't you,, sloppyboppy?;;I told Tod they were nice fellows just down on their luck like a lot of;people these days. There's an awful lot of unemployment going around.;;That's right,, she said. If they go,, I go.;;Tod had guessed as much. He realized there was no use in saying anything.;Homer was again signaling for him to keep quiet.;;For some reason or other,, Faye suddenly became ashamed of herself. She;apologized to Tod by offering to dance with him again,, flirting as she;suggested it. Tod refused.;;She broke the silence that followed by a eulogy of Miguel's game;chickens,, which was really meant to be an excuse for herself. She;described what marvelous fighters the birds were,, how much Miguel loved;them and what good care he took of them.;;Homer agreed enthusiastically. Tod remained silent. She asked him if he;had ever seen a cock fight and invited him to the garage for the next;night. A man from San Diego was coming north with his birds to pit them;against Miguel's.;;When she turned to Homer again,, he leaned away as though she were going;to hit him. She flushed with shame at this and looked at Tod to see if he;had noticed. The rest of the evening,, she tried to be nice to Homer. She;even touched him a little,, straightening his collar and patting his hair;smooth. He beamed happily.;;;21;;;When Tod told Claude Estee about the cock fight,, he wanted to go with;him. They drove to Homer's place together.;;It was one of those blue and lavender nights when the luminous color;seems to have been blown over the scene with an air brush. Even the;darkest shadows held some purple.;;A car stood in the driveway of the garage with its headlights on. They;could see several men in the corner of the building and could hear their;voices. Someone laughed,, using only two notes,, ha-ha and ha-ha,, over and;over again.;;Tod stepped ahead,, to make himself known,, in case they were taking;precautions against the police. When he entered the light,, Abe Kusich and;Miguel greeted him,, but Earle didn't.;;The fights are off,, Abe said. That stinkola from Diego didn't get;here.;;Claude came up and Tod introduced him to the three men. The dwarf was;arrogant,, Miguel gracious and Earle his usual wooden,, surly self.;;Most of the garage floor had been converted into a pit,, an oval space;about nine feet long and seven or eight wide. It was floored with an old;carpet and walled by a low,, ragged fence made of odd pieces of lath and;wire. Faye's coupe stood in the driveway,, placed so that its headlights;flooded the arena.;;Claude and Tod followed Abe out of the glare and sat down with him on an;old trunk in the back of the garage. Earle and Miguel came in and;squatted on their heels facing them. They were both wearing blue denims,,;polka-dot shirts,, big hats and high-heeled boots. They looked very;handsome and picturesque.;;They sat smoking silently,, all of them calm except the dwarf,, who was;fidgety. Although he had plenty of room,, he suddenly gave Tod a shove.;;Get over,, lard-ass,, he snarled.;;Tod moved,, crowding against Claude,, without saying anything. Earle;laughed at Tod rather than the dwarf,, but the dwarf turned on him anyway.;;Why,, you punkola! Who you laughing at?;;You,, Earle said.;;That so,, hah? Well,, listen to me,, you pee-hole bandit,, for two cents I'd;knock you out of them prop boots. Earle reached into his shirt pocket;and threw a coin on the ground.;;There's a nickel,, he said.;;The dwarf started to get off the trunk,, but Tod caught him by the collar.;He didn't try to get loose,, but leaned forward against his coat,, like a;terrier in a harness,, and wagged his great head from side to side.;;Go on,, he sputtered,, you fugitive from the Western Costume Company,,;you...you louse in a fright-wig,, you.;;Earle would have been much less angry if he could have thought of a;snappy comeback. He mumbled something about a half-pint bastard,, then;spat. He hit the instep of the dwarf's shoe with a big gob of spittle.;;Nice shot,, Miguel said.;;This was apparently enough for Earle to consider himself the winner,, for;he smiled and became quiet. The dwarf slapped Tod's hand away from his;collar with a curse and settled down on the trunk again.;;He ought to wear gaffs,, Miguel said.;;I don't need them for a punk like that.;;They all laughed and everything was fine again. Abe leaned across Tod to;speak to Claude.;;It would have been a swell main,, he said. There was more than a dozen;guys here before you come and some of them with real dough. I was going;to make book. He took out his wallet and gave him one of his business;cards.;;It was in the bag,, Miguel said. I got five birds that would of won;easy and two sure losers. We would of made a killing.;;I've never seen a chicken fight,, Claude said. In fact,, I've never even;seen a game chicken.;;Miguel offered to show him one of his birds and left to get it. Tod went;down to the car for the bottle of whiskey they had left In a side pocket.;When he got back,, Miguel was holding Jujutala in the light. They all;examined the bird.;;Miguel held the cock firmly with both hands,, somewhat in the manner that;a basketball is held,, for an underhand toss. The bird had short,, oval;wings and a heart-shaped tail that stood at right angles to its body. It;had a triangular head,, like a snake's,, terminating in a slightly curved;beak,, thick at the base and fine at the point. All its feathers were so;tight and hard that they looked as though they had been varnished. They;had been thinned out for fighting and the lines of its body,, which was;like a truncated wedge,, stood out plainly. From between Miguel's fingers;dangled its long,, bright orange legs and its slightly darker feet with;their horn nails.;;Juju was bred by John R. Bowes of Lindale,, Texas,, Miguel said proudly.;He's a six times winner. I give fifty dollars and a shotgun for him.;;He's a nice bird,, the dwarf said grudgingly,, but looks ain't;everything.;;Claude took out his wallet.;;I'd like to see him fight,, he said. Suppose you sell me one of your;other birds and I put it against him.;;Miguel thought a while and looked at Earle,, who told him to go ahead.;;I've 'got a bird I'll sell you for fifteen bucks,, he said. The dwarf;interfered.;;Let me pick the bird.;;Oh,, I don't care,, Claude said,, I just want to see a fight. Here's your;fifteen.;;Earle took the money and Miguel told him to get Hermano,, the big red.;;That red'll go over eight pounds,, he said,, while Juju won't go more;than six.;;Earle came back carrying a large rooster that had a silver shawl. He;looked like an ordinary barnyard fowl. When the dwarf saw him,, he became;indignant. What do you call that,, a goose?;;That's one of Street's Butcher Boys,, Miguel said. I wouldn't bait a;hook with him,, the dwarf said. You don't have to bet,, Earle mumbled.;;The dwarf eyed the bird and the bird eyed him. He turned to Claude.;;Let me handle him for you,, mister,, he said. Miguel spoke quickly.;;Earle'll do it. He knows the cock.;;The dwarf exploded at this.;;It's a frame-up! he yelled.;;He tried to take the red,, but Earle held the bird high in the air out of;the little man's reach.;;Miguel opened the trunk and took out a small wooden box,, the kind;chessmen are kept in. It was full of curved gaffs,, small squares of;chamois with holes in their centers and bits of waxed string like that;used by a shoemaker. They crowded around to watch him arm. Juju. First he;wiped the short stubs on the cock's legs to make sure they were clean and;then placed a leather square over one of them so that the stub came;through the hole. He then fitted a gaff over it and fastened it with a;bit of the soft string,, wrapping very carefully. He did the same to the;other leg.;;When he had finished,, Earle started on the big red. That's a bird with;lots of cojones,, Miguel said. He's won plenty fights. He don't look;fast maybe,, but he's fast all right and he packs an awful wallop.;;Strictly for the cook stove,, if you ask me,, the dwarf said.;;Earle took out a pair of shears and started to lighten the red's plumage.;The dwarf watched him cut away most of the bird's tail,, but when he began;to work on the breast,, he caught his hand.;;Leave him be! he barked. You'll kill him fast that way. He needs that;stuff for protection.;;He turned to Claude again.;;Please,, mister,, let me handle him.;;Make him buy a share in the bird,, Miguel said.;;Claude laughed and motioned for Earle to give Abe the bird. Earle didn't;want to and looked meaningly at Miguel. The dwarf began to dance with;rage.;;You're trying to cold-deck us! he screamed.;;Aw,, give it to him,, Miguel said.;;The little man tucked the bird under his left arm so that his hands were;free and began to look over the gaffs in the box. They were all the same;length,, three inches,, but some had more pronounced curves than the;others. He selected a pair and explained his strategy to Claude.;;He's going to do most of his fighting on his back. This pair'll hit;right that way. If he could get over the other bird,, I wouldn't use;them.;;He got down on his knees and honed the gaffs on the cement floor until;they were like needles.;;Have we a chance? Tod asked.;;You can't ever tell,, he said,, shaking his extra large head. He feels;almost like a dead bird.;;After adjusting the gaffs with great care,, he looked the bird over,,;stretching its wings and blowing its feathers in order to see its skin.;;The comb ain't bright enough for fighting condition,, he said,, pinching;it,, but he looks strong. He may have been a good one once.;;He held the bird in the light and looked at its head. When Miguel saw him;examining its beak,, he told him anxiously to quit stalling. But the dwarf;paid no attention 'and went on muttering to himself. He motioned for Tod;and Claude to look.;;What'd I tell you! he said,, puffing with indignation. We've been;cold-decked.;;He pointed to a hair line running across the top of the bird's beak.;;That's not a crack,, Miguel protested,, it's just a mark. He reached;for the bird as though to rub its beak and the bird pecked savagely at;him. This pleased the dwarf. We'll fight,, he said,, but we won't bet.;;Earle was to referee. He took a piece of chalk and drew three lines in;the center of the pit,, a long one in the middle and two shorter ones;parallel to it and about three feet away.;;Pit your cocks,, he called.;;No,, bill them first,, the dwarf protested.;;He and Miguel stood at arm's length and thrust their birds together to;anger them. Juju caught the big red by the comb and held on viciously;until Miguel jerked him away. The red,, who had been rather apathetic,,;came to life and the dwarf had trouble holding him. The two men thrust;their birds together again,, and again Juju caught the red's comb. The big;cock became frantic with rage and struggled to get at the smaller bird.;;We're ready,, the dwarf said.;;He and Miguel climbed into the pit and set their birds down on the short;lines so that they faced each other. They held them by the tails and;waited for Earle to give the signal to let go.;;Pit them,, he ordered.;;The dwarf had been watching Earle's lips and he had his bird off first,,;but Juju rose straight in the air and sank one spur in the red's breast.;It went through the feathers into the flesh. The red turned with the gaff;still stuck in him and pecked twice at his opponent's head.;;They separated the birds and held them to the lines again.;;Pit 'em! Earle shouted.;;Again Juju got above the other bird,, but this time he missed with his;spurs. The red tried to get above him,, but couldn't. He was too clumsy;and heavy to fight in the air. Juju climbed again,, cutting and hitting so;rapidly that his legs were a golden blur. The red met him by going back;on his tail and hooking upward like a cat. Juju landed again and again.;He broke one of the red's wings,, then practically severed a leg.;;Handle them,, Earle called.;;When the dwarf gathered the red up,, its neck had.. begun to droop and it;was a mass of blood and matted feathers. The little man moaned over the;bird,, then set to work. He spit into its gaping beak and took the comb;between his lips and sucked the blood back into it. The red began to;regain its fury,, but not its strength. Its beak closed and its neck;straightened. The dwarf smoothed and shaped its plumage. He could no;nothing to help the broken wing or the dangling leg.;;Pit 'em,, Earle said.;;The dwarf insisted that the birds be put down beak to beak on the center;line,, so that the red would not have to move to get at his opponent.;Miguel agreed.;;The red was very gallant. When Abe let go of its tail,, it made a great;effort to get off the ground and meet Juju in the air,, but it could only;thrust with one leg and fell over on its side. Juju sailed above it,, half;turned and came down on its back,, driving in both spurs. The red twisted;free,, throwing Juju,, and made a terrific effort to hook with its good;leg,, but fell sideways again.;;Before Juju could get into the air,, the red managed to drive a hard blow;with its beak to Juju's head. This slowed the smaller bird down and he;fought on the ground. In the pecking match,, the red's greater weight and;strength evened up for his lack of a leg and a wing. He managed to give;as good as he got. But suddenly his cracked beak broke off,, leaving only;the lower half. A large bubble of blood rose where the beak had been. The;red didn't retreat an inch,, but made a great effort to get into the air;once more. Using its one leg skillfully,, it managed to rise six or seven;inches from the ground,, not enough,, however,, to get its spurs into play.;Juju went up with him and got well above,, then drove both gaffs into the;red's breast. Again one of the steel needles stuck.;;Handle them,, Earle shouted.;;Miguel freed his bird and gave the other back to the dwarf. Abe,, moaning;softly,, smoothed its feathers and licked its eyes clean,, then took its;whole head in his mouth. The red was finished,, however. It couldn't even;hold its neck straight. The dwarf blew away the feathers from under its;tail and pressed the lips of its vent together hard. When that didn't;seem to help,, he inserted his little finger and scratched the bird's;testicles. It fluttered and made a gallant effort to straighten its neck.;;Pit birds.;;Once more the red tried to rise with Juju,, pushing hard with its;remaining leg,, but it only spun crazily. Juju rose,, but missed. The red;thrust weakly with its broken bill. Juju went into the air again and this;time drove a gaff through one of the red's eyes into its brain. The red;fell over stone dead.;;The dwarf groaned with anguish,, but no one else said anything. Juju;pecked at the dead bird's remaining eye.;;Take off that stinking cannibal! the dwarf screamed.;;Miguel laughed,, then caught Juju and removed its gaffs. Earle did the;same for the red. He handled the dead cock gently and with respect.;;Tod passed the whiskey.;;;22;;;They were well on their way to getting drunk when Homer came out to the;garage. He gave a little start when he saw the dead chicken sprawled on;the carpet. He shook hands with Claude after Tod introduced him,, and with;Abe Kusich,, then made a little set speech about everybody coming in for a;drink. They trooped after him. Faye greeted them at the door. She was;wearing a pair of green silk lounging pajamas and green mules with large;pompons and very high heels. The top three buttons of her jacket were;open and a good deal of her chest was exposed but nothing of her breasts,;;not because they were small,, but because they were placed wide apart and;their thrust was upward and outward.;;She gave Tod her hand and patted the dwarf on the top of the head. They;were old friends. In acknowledging Homer's awkward introduction of;Claude,, she was very much the lady. It was her favorite role and she;assumed it whenever she met a new man,, especially if he were someone;whose affluence was obvious.;;Charmed to have you,, she trilled.;;The dwarf laughed at her.;;In a voice stiff with hauteur,, she then ordered Homer into the kitchen;for soda,, ice and glasses.;;A swell layout,, announced the dwarf,, putting on the hat he had taken;off in the doorway.;;He climbed into one of the big Spanish chairs,, using his knees and hands;to do it,, and sat on the edge with his feet dangling. He looked like a;ventriloquist's dummy.;;Earle and Miguel had remained behind to wash up. When they came in,, Faye;welcomed them with stilted condescension.;;How do you do,, boys? The refreshments will be along in a jiffy. But;perhaps you prefer a liqueur,, Miguel?;;No,, mum,, he said,, a little startled. I'll have what the others have.;;He followed Earle across the room to the couch. Both of them took long,,;wooden steps,, as though they weren't used to being in a house. They sat;down gingerly with their backs straight,, their big hats on their knees;and their hands under their hats. They had combed their hair before;leaving the garage and their small round heads glistened prettily.;;Homer took the drinks around on a small tray.;;They all made a show of manners,, all but the dwarf,, that is,, who remained;as arrogant as ever. He even commented on the quality of the whiskey. As;soon as everyone had been served,, Homer sat down.;;Faye alone remained standing. She was completely self-possessed despite;their stares. She stood with one hip thrown out and her hand on it. From;where Claude was sitting he could follow the charming line of her spine;as it swooped into her buttocks,, which were like a heart upside down.;;He gave a low whistle of admiration and everyone agreed by moving;uneasily or laughing.;;My dear,, she said to Homer,, perhaps some of the men would like;cigars?;;He was surprised and mumbled something about there being no cigars in the;house but that he would go to the store for them if...Having to say all;this made him unhappy and he took the whiskey around again. He poured;very generous shots.;;That's a becoming shade of green,, Tod said.;;Faye peacocked for them all.;;I thought maybe it was a little gaudy...vulgar,, you know.;;No,, Claude said enthusiastically,, it's stunning.;;She repaid him for his compliment by smiling in a peculiar,, secret way;and running her tongue over her lips. It was one of her most;characteristic gestures and very effective. It seemed to promise all;sorts of undefined intimacies,, yet it was really as simple and automatic;as the word thanks. She used it to reward anyone for anything,, no matter;how unimportant.;;Claude made the same mistake Tod had often made and jumped to his feet.;;Won't you sit here? he said,, waving gallantly at his chair.;;She accepted by repeating the secret smile and the tongue caress. Claude;bowed,, but then,, realizing that everyone was watching him,, added a little;mock flourish to make himself less ridiculous. Tod joined them,, then;Earle and Miguel came over. Claude did the courting while the others;stood by and stared at her.;;Do you work in pictures,, Mr. Estee? she asked.;;Yes. You're in pictures,, of course?;;Everyone was aware of the begging note in his voice,, but no one smiled.;They didn't blame him. It was almost impossible to keep that note out;when talking to her. Men used it just to say good morning.;;Not exactly,, but I hope to be,, she said. I've worked as an extra,, but;I haven't had a real chance yet. I expect to get one soon. All I ask is a;chance. Acting is in my blood. We Greeners,, you know,, were all theatre;people from away back.;;Yes. I...;;She didn't let Claude finish,, but he didn't care.;;Not musicals,, but real dramas. Of course,, maybe light comedies at first.;All I ask is a chance. I've been buying a lot of clothes lately to make;myself one. I don't believe in luck. Luck is just hard work,, they say,,;and I'm willing to work as hard as anybody.;;You have a delightful voice and you handle it well,, he said.;;He couldn't help it. Having once seen her secret smile and the things;that accompanied it,, he wanted to make her repeat it again and again.;;I'd like to do a show on Broadway,, she continued. That's the way to;get a start nowadays. They won't talk to you unless you've had stage;experience.;;She went on and on,, telling him how careers are made in the movies and;how she intended to make hers. It was all nonsense. She mixed bits of;badly understood advice from the trade papers with other bits out of the;fan magazines and compared these with the legends that surround the;activities of screen stars and executives. Without any noticeable;transition,, possibilities became probabilities and wound up as;inevitabilities. At first she occasionally stopped and waited for Claude;to chorus a hearty agreement,, but when she had a good start,, all her;questions were rhetorical and the stream of words rippled on without a;break.;;None of them really heard her. They were all too busy watching her smile,,;laugh,, shiver,, whisper,, grow indignant,, cross and uncross her legs,, stick;out her tongue,, widen and narrow her eyes,, toss her head so that her;platinum hair splashed against the red plush of the chair back. The;strange thing about her gestures and expressions was that they didn't;really illustrate what she was saying. They were almost pure. It was as;though her body recognized how foolish her words were and tried to excite;her hearers into being uncritical. It worked that night,; no one even;thought of laughing at her. The only move they made was to narrow their;circle about her.;;Tod stood on the outer edge,, watching her through the opening between;Earle and the Mexican. When he felt a light tap on his shoulder,, he knew;it was Homer,, but didn't turn. When the tap was repeated,, he shrugged the;hand away. A few minutes later,, he heard a shoe squeak behind him and;turned to see Homer tiptoeing off. He reached a chair safely and sank;into it with a sigh. He put his heavy hands on the knees,, one on each,,;and stared for a while at their backs. He felt Tod's eyes on him and;looked up and smiled.;;His smile annoyed Tod. It was one of those irritating smiles that seem to;say: My friend,, what can you know of suffering? There was something;very patronizing and superior about it,, and intolerably snobbish.;;He felt hot and a little sick. He turned his back on Hamer and went out;the front door. His indignant exit wasn't very successful. He wobbled;quite badly and when he reached the sidewalk,, he had to sit down on the;curb with his back against a date palm.;;From where he was sitting,, he couldn't see the city in the valley below;the canyon,, but he could see the reflection of its lights,, which hung in;the sky above it like a batik parasol. The unlighted part of the sky at;the edge of the parasol was a deep black with hardly a trace of blue.;;Homer followed him out of the house and stood standing behind him,, afraid;to approach. He might have sneaked away without Tod's knowing it,, if he;had not suddenly looked down and seen his shadow.;;Hello,, he said.;;He motioned for Homer to join him on the curb. You'll catch cold,, Homer;said.;;Tod understood his protest. He made it because he wanted to be certain;that his company was really welcome. Nevertheless,, Tod refused to repeat;the invitation. He didn't even turn to look at him again. He was sure he;was wearing his long-suffering smile and didn't want to see it.;;He wondered why all his sympathy had turned to malice. Because of Faye?;It was impossible for him to admit it. Because he was unable to do;anything to help him? This reason was a more comfortable one,, but he;dismissed it with even less consideration. He had never set himself up as;a healer.;;Homer was looking the other way,, at the house,, watching the parlor;window. He cocked his head to one side when someone laughed. The four;short sounds,, ha-ha and again ha-ha,, distinct musical notes,, were made by;the dwarf.;;You could learn from him,, Tod said.;;What? Homer asked,, turning to look at him.;;Let it go.;;His impatience both hurt and puzzled Homer. He saw that and motioned for;him to sit down,, this time emphatically.;;Homer obeyed. He did a poor job of squatting and hurt himself. He sat;nursing his knee.;;What is it? Tod finally said,, making an attempt to be kind.;;Nothing,, Tod,, nothing.;;He was grateful and increased his smile. Tod couldn't help seeing all its;annoying attributes,, resignation,, kindliness,, and humility.;;They sat quietly,, Homer with his heavy shoulders hunched and the sweet;grin on his face,, Tod frowning,, his back pressed hard against the palm;tree. In the house the radio was playing and its blare filled the street.;;They sat for a long time without speaking. Several times Homer started to;tell Tod something but he didn't seem able to get the words out. Tod;refused to help him with a question.;;His big hands left his lap,, where they had been playing here's the;church and here the steeple,, and hid in his armpits. They remained there;for a moment,, then slid under his thighs. A moment later they were back;in his lap. The right hand cracked the joints of the left,, one by one,,;then the left did the same service for the right. They seemed easier for;a moment,, but not for long. They started here's the church again,, going;through the entire performance and ending with the joint manipulation as;before. He started a third time,, but catching Tod's eyes,, he stopped and;trapped his hands between his knees.;;It was the most complicated tic Tod had ever seen. What made it;particularly horrible was its precision. It wasn't pantomime,, as he had;first thought,, but manual ballet.;;When Tod saw the hands start to crawl out again,, he exploded.;;For Christ's sake!;;The hands struggled to get free,, but Homer clamped his knees shut and;held them.;;I'm sorry,, he said.;;Oh,, all right.;;But I can't help it,, Tod. I have to do it three times.;;Okay with me.;;He turned his back on him.;;Faye started to sing and her voice poured into the street;;Dreamed about a reefer five feet long;Not too mild and not too strong,,;You'll be high,, but not for long,,;If you're a viper--a vi-paah.;;Instead of her usual swing delivery,, she was using a lugubrious one,,;wailing the tune as though it were a dirge. At the end of every stanza,,;she shifted to an added minor.;;I'm the queen of everything,,;Gotta be high before I can swing,,;Light a tea and let it be,,;If you're a viper--a vi-paah.;;She sings very pretty,, Homer said.;;She's drunk.;;I don't know what to do,, Tod,, Homer complained. She's drinking an;awful lot lately. It's that Earle. We used to have a lot of fun before be;came,, but now we don't have any fun any more since he started to hang;around.;;Why don't you get rid of him?;;I was thinking about what you said about the license to keep chickens.;;Tod understood what he wanted.;;I'll report them to the Board of Health tomorrow.;;Homer thanked him,, then insisted on explaining in detail why he couldn't;do it himself.391;;But that'll only get rid of the Mexican,, Tod said. You'll have to;throw Earle out yourself.;;Maybe he'll go with his friend?;;Tod knew that Homer was begging him to agree so that he could go on;hoping,, but he refused.;;Not a chance. You'll have to throw him out;;Homer accepted this with his brave,, sweet smile. Maybe...;;Tell Faye to do it,, Tod said.;;Oh,, I can't;;Why the hell not? It's your house.;;Don't be mad at me,, Toddle.;;All right,, Homie,, I'm not mad at you.;;Faye's voice came through the open window.;;And when your throat gets dry,,;You know you're high,,;If you're a viper.;;The others harmonized on the last word,, repeating it. Vi-paah...;;Toddle,, Homer began,, if...;;Stop calling me Toddle,, for Christ's sake!;;Homer didn't understand. He took Tod's hand.;;I didn't mean nothing. Back home we call...;;Tod couldn't stand his trembling signals of affection. He tore free with;a jerk.;;Oh,, but,, Toddle,, I...;;She's a whore!;;He heard Homer grunt,, then heard his knees creak as he struggled to his;feet.;;Faye's voice came pouring through the window,, a reedy wail that broke in;the middle with a husky catch.;;High,, high,, high,, high,, when you're high,,;Everything is dandy,,;Truck on down to the candy store,,;Bust your conk on peppermint candy!;Then you know your body's sent,,;Don't care if you don't pay rent,,;Sky is high and so am I,,;If you're a viper--a vi-paah.;;;23;;;When Tod went back into the house,, he found Earle,, Abe Kusich and Claude;standing together in a tight group,, watching Faye dance with Miguel. She;and the Mexican were doing a slow tango to music from the phonograph. He;held her very tight,, one of his legs thrust between hers,, and they swayed;together in long spirals that broke rhythmically at the top of each curve;into a dip. All the buttons on her lounging pajamas were open and the arm;he had around her waist was inside her clothes.;;Tod stood watching the dancers from the doorway for a moment,, then went;to a little table on which the whiskey bottle was. He poured himself a;quarter of a tumblerful,, tossed it off,, then poured another drink.;Carrying the glass,, he went over to Claude and the others. They paid no;attention to him,; their heads moved only to follow the dancers,, like the;gallery at a tennis match.;;Did you see Homer? Tod asked,, touching Claude's arm. Claude didn't;turn,, but the dwarf did. He spoke as though hypnotized.;;What a quiff! What a quiff!;;Tod left them and went to look for Homer. He wasn't in the kitchen,, so he;tried the bedrooms. One of them was locked. He knocked lightly,, waited,,;then repeated the knock. There was no answer,, but he thought he heard;someone move. He looked through the keyhole. The room was pitch dark.;;Homer,, he called softly.;;He heard the bed creak,, then Homer replied.;;Who is it?;;It's me--Toddie.;;He used the diminutive with perfect seriousness. Go away,, please,, Homer;said.;;Let me in for a minute. I want to explain something.;;No,, Homer said,, go away,, please.;;Tod went back to the living room. The phonograph record had been changed;to a fox-trot and Earle was now dancing with Faye. He had both his arms;around her in a bear hug and they were stumbling all over the room,,;bumping into the walls and furniture. Faye,, her head thrown back,, was;laughing wildly. Earle had both eyes shut tight.;;Miguel and Claude were also laughing,, but not the dwarf. He stood with;his fists clenched and his chin stuck out. When he couldn't stand any;more of it,, he ran after the dancers to cut in. He caught Earle by the;seat of his trousers.;;Le'me dance,, he barked.;;Earle turned his head,, looking down at the dwarf from over his shoulder.;;Git! G'wan,, git!;;Faye and Earle had come to a halt with their arms around each other. When;the dwarf lowered his head like a goat and tried to push between them,,;she reached down and tweaked his nose.;;Le'me dance,, he bellowed.;;They tried to start again,, but Abe wouldn't let them. He had his hands;between them and was trying frantically to pull them apart. When that;wouldn't work,, he kicked Earle sharply in the shins. Earle kicked back;and his boot landed in the little man's stomach,, knocking him flat on his;back. Everyone laughed.;;The dwarf struggled to his feet and stood with his head lowered like a;tiny ram. Just as Faye and Earle started to dance again,, he charged;between Earle's legs and dug upward with both hands. Earle screamed with;pain,, and tried to get at him. He screamed again,, then groaned and;started to sink to the floor,, tearing Faye's silk pajamas on his way;down.;;Miguel grabbed Abe by the throat. The dwarf let go his hold and Earle;sank to the floor. Lifting the little man free,, Miguel shifted his grip;to his ankles and dashed him against the wall,, like a man killing a;rabbit against a tree. He swung the dwarf back to slam him again,, but Tod;caught his arm. Then Claude grabbed the dwarf and together they pulled;him away from the Mexican.;;He was unconscious. They carried him into the kitchen and held him under;the cold water. He came to quickly and began to curse. When they saw he;was all right,, they went back to the living room.;;Miguel was helping Earle over to the couch. All the tan had drained from;his face and it was covered with sweat. Miguel loosened his trousers;while Claude took off his necktie and opened his collar.;;Faye and Tod watched from the side.;;Look,, she said,, my new pajamas are ruined.;;One of the sleeves had been pulled almost off and her shoulder stuck;through it. The trousers were also torn. While he stared at her,, she;undid the top of the trousers and stepped out of them. She was wearing;tight black lace drawers. Tod took a step toward her and hesitated. She;threw the pajama bottoms over her arm,, turned slowly and walked toward;the door.;;Faye,, Tod gasped.;;She stopped and smiled at him.;;I'm going to bed,, she said. Get that little guy out of here.;;Claude came over and took Tod by the arm.;;Let's blow,, he said.;;Tod nodded.;;We'd better take the homunculus with us or he's liable to murder the;whole household.;;Tod nodded again and followed him into the kitchen. They found the dwarf;holding a big piece of ice to the side of his head.;;There's some lump where that greaser slammed me. He made them finger;and admire it.;;Let's go home,, Claude said.;;No,, said the dwarf,, let's go see some girls. I'm just getting;started.;;To hell with that,, snapped Tod. Come on.;;He pushed the dwarf toward the door.;;Take your hands off,, punk! roared the little man. Claude stepped;between them.;;Easy there,, citizen,, he said.;;All right,, but no shoving.;;He strutted out and they followed.;;Earle still lay stretched on the couch. He had his eyes closed and was;holding himself below the stomach with both hands. Miguel wasn't there.;;Abe chuckled,, wagging his big head gleefully.;;I fixed that buckeroo.;;Out on the sidewalk he tried again to get them to go with him.;;Come on,, you guys--we'll have some fun.;;I'm going home,, Claude said.;;They went with the dwarf to his car and watched him climb in behind the;wheel. He had special extensions on the clutch and brake so that he could;reach them with his tiny feet.;;Come to town?;;No,, thanks,, Claude said politely.;;Then to hell with you!;;That was his farewell. He let out the brake and the car rolled away.;;;24;;;Tod woke up the next morning with a splitting headache. He called the;studio to say he wouldn't be in and remained in bed until noon,, then went;downtown for breakfast. After several cups of hot tea,, he felt a little;better and decided to visit Homer. He still wanted to apologize.;;Climbing the hill to Pinyon Canyon made his head throb and he was;relieved when no one answered his repeated knocks. As he started away,, he;saw one of the curtains move and went back to knock once more. There was;still no answer.;;He went around to the garage. Faye's car was gone and so were the game;chickens. He went to the back of the house and knocked on the kitchen;door. Somehow the silence seemed too complete. He tried the handle and;found that the door wasn't locked. He shouted hello a few times,, as a;warning,, then went through the kitchen into the living room.;;The red velvet curtains were all drawn tight,, but he could see Homer;sitting on the couch and staring at the backs of his hands which were;cupped over his knees. He wore an old-fashioned cotton nightgown and his;feet were bare.;;Just get up?;;Homer neither moved nor replied.;;Tod tried again.;;Some party!;;He knew it was stupid to be hearty,, but he didn't know what else to be.;;Boy,, have I got a hang-over,, he went on,, even going so far as to;attempt a chuckle.;;Homer paid absolutely no attention to him.;;The room was just as they had left it the night before. Tables and;chairs were overturned and the smashed picture lay where it had fallen.;To give himself a reason for staying,, he began to tidy up. He righted the;chairs,, straightened the carpet and picked up the cigarette butts that;littered the floor. He also threw aside the curtains and opened a window.;;There,, that's better,, isn't it? he asked cheerfully.;;Homer looked up for a second,, then down at his hands again. Tod saw that;he was coming out of his stupor. Want some coffee? he asked.;;He lifted his hands from his knees and hid them in his armpits,, clamping;them tight,, but didn't answer.;;Some hot coffee--what do you say?;;He took his hands from under his arms and sat on them. After waiting a;little while he shook his head no,, slowly,, heavily,, like a dog with a;foxtail in its ear.;;I'll make some.;;Tod went to the kitchen and put the pot on the stove. While it was;boiling,, he took a peek into Faye's room. It had been stripped. All the;dresser drawers were pulled out and there were empty boxes all over the;floor. A broken flask of perfume lay in the middle of the carpet and the;place reeked of gardenia.;;When the coffee was ready,, he poured two cups and carried them into the;living room on a tray. He found Homer just as he had left him,, sitting on;his hands. He moved a small table close to him and put the tray on it.;;I brought a cup for myself,, too,, he said. Come on--drink it while it's;hot.;;Tod lifted a cup and held it out,, but when he saw that he was going to;speak,, he put it down and waited.;;I'm going back to Wayneville,, Homer said.;;A swell idea--great!;;He pushed the coffee at him again. Homer ignored it. He gulped several;times,, trying to swallow something that was stuck in his throat,, then;began to sob. He cried without covering his face or bending his head. The;sound was like an ax chopping pine,, a heavy,, hollow,, chunking noise. It;was repeated rhythmically but without accent. There was no progress in;it. Each chunk was exactly like the one that preceded. It would never;reach a climax.;;Tod realized that there was no use trying to stop him. Only a very stupid;man would have the courage to try to do it. He went to the farthest;corner of the room and waited.;;Just as he was about to light a second cigarette,, Homer called him.;;Tod!;;I'm here,, Homer.;;He hurried over to the couch again.;;Homer was still crying,, but he suddenly stopped more abruptly than he had;started.;;Yes,, Homer? Tod asked encouragingly.;;She's left;;Yes,, I know. Drink some coffee.;;She's left.;;Tod knew that he put a great deal of faith in sayings,, so he tried one.;;Good riddance to bad rubbish.;;She left before I got up,, he said.;;What the hell do you care? You're going back to Wayneville.;;You shouldn't curse,, Homer said with the same lunatic calm.;;I'm sorry,, Tod mumbled.;;The word sorry was like dynamite set off under a dam. Language leaped;out of Homer in a muddy,, twisting torrent. At first,, Tod thought it would;do him a lot of good to pour out in this way. But he was wrong. The lake;behind the dam replenished itself too fast. The more he talked the;greater the pressure grew because the flood was circular and ran back;behind the dam again.;;After going on continuously for about twenty minutes,, he stopped in the;middle of a sentence. He leaned back,, closed his eyes and seemed to fall;asleep. Tod put a cushion under his head. After watching him for a while,,;he went back to the kitchen.;;He sat down and tried to make sense out of what Homer had told him. A;great deal of it was gibberish. Some of it,, however,, wasn't. He hit on a;key that helped when he realized that a lot of it wasn't jumbled so much;as timeless. The words went behind each other instead of after. What he;had taken for long strings were really one thick word and not a sentence.;In the same way several sentences were simultaneous and not a paragraph.;Using key,, he was able to arrange a part of what he had so that it made;the usual kind of sense.;;After Tod had hurt him by saying that nasty thing about Faye,, Homer ran;around to the back of the house and let himself in through the kitchen,,;then went to peek into the parlor. He wasn't angry with Tod,, just;surprised and upset because Tod was a nice boy. From the hall that led;into the parlor he could see everybody having a good time and he was;glad because it was kind of dull for Faye living with an old man like;him. It made her restless. No one noticed him peeking there and he was;glad because he didn't feel much like joining the fun,, although he liked;to watch people enjoy themselves. Faye was dancing with Mr. Estee and;they made a nice pair. She seemed happy. Her face shone like always when;she was happy. Next she danced with Earle. He didn't like that because of;the way he held her. He couldn't see what she saw in that fellow. He just;wasn't nice,, that's all. He had mean eyes. In the hotel business they;used to watch out for fellows like that and never gave them credit;because they would jump their bills. Maybe he couldn't get a job because;nobody would trust him,, although it was true as Faye said that a lot of;people were out of work nowadays. Standing there peeking at the party,,;enjoying the laughing and singing,, he saw Earle catch Faye and bend her;back and kiss her and everybody laughed although you could see Faye;didn't like it because she slapped his face. Earle didn't care,, he just;kissed her again,, a long nasty one. She got away from him and ran toward;the door where he was standing. He tried to hide,, but she caught him.;Although he didn't say anything,, she said he was nasty spying on her and;wouldn't listen when he tried to explain. She went into her room and he;followed to tell about the peeking,, but she carried on awful and cursed;him some more as she put red on her lips. Then she knocked over the;perfume. That made her twice as mad. He tried to explain but she wouldn't;listen and just went on calling him all sorts of dirty things. So he went;to his room and got undressed and tried to go to sleep. Then Tod woke him;up and wanted to come in and talk. He wasn't angry,, but didn't feel like;talking just then,, all he wanted to do was go to sleep. Tod went away and;no sooner had he climbed back into bed when there was some awful;screaming and banging. He was afraid to go out and see and he thought of;calling the police,, but he was scared to go in the hall where the phone;was so he started to get dressed to climb out of the window and go for;help because it sounded like murder but before he finished putting his;shoes on,, he heard Tod talking to Faye and he figured that it must be all;right or she wouldn't be laughing so he got undressed and went back to;bed again. He couldn't fall asleep wondering what had happened,, so when;the house was quiet,, he took a chance and knocked on Faye's door to find;out. Faye let him in. She was curled up in bed like a little girl. She;called him daddy and kissed him and said that she wasn't angry at him at;all. She said there had been a fight but nobody got hurt much and for him;to go back to bed and that they would talk more in the morning. He went;back like she said and fell asleep,, but he woke up again as it was just;breaking daylight. At first he wondered why he was up because when he;once fell asleep,, usually he didn't get up before the alarm clock rang.;He knew that something had happened,, but he didn't know what until he;heard a noise in Faye's room. It was a moan and he thought he was;dreaming,, but he heard it again. Sure enough,, Faye was moaning all right.;He thought she must be sick. She moaned again like in pain. He got out of;bed and went to her door and knocked and asked if she was sick. She;didn't answer and the moaning stopped so he went back to bed. A little;later,, she moaned again so he got out of bed,, thinking she might want the;hot water bottle or some aspirin and a drink of water or something and;knocked on her door again,, only meaning to help her. She heard him and;said something. He didn't understand what but he thought she meant for;him to go in. Lots of times when she had a headache he brought her an;aspirin and a glass of water in the middle of the night The door wasn't;locked. You'd have thought she would have locked the door because the;Mexican was in bed with her,, both of them naked and she had her arms;around him. Faye saw him and pulled the sheets over her head without;saying anything. He didn't know what to do,, so he backed out of the room;and closed the door. He was standing in the hall,, trying to figure out;what to do,, feeling so ashamed,, when Earle appeared with his boots in his;hand. He must have been sleeping in the parlor. He wanted to know what;the trouble was. Faye's sick,, he said,, and I'm getting her a glass of;water. But then Faye moaned again and Earle heard it. He pushed open the;door. Faye screamed. He could hear Earl and Miguel cursing each other and;fighting. He was afraid to call the police on account of Faye and didn't;know what to do. Faye kept on screaming. When he opened the door again,,;Miguel fell out with Earle on top of him and both of them tearing at each;other. He ran inside the room and locked the door. She had the sheets;over her head,, screaming. He could hear Earle and Miguel fighting in the;hall and then he couldn't hear them any more. She kept the sheets over;her head. He tried to talk to her but she wouldn't answer. He sat down on;a chair to guard her in case Earle and Miguel came back,, but they didn't;and after a while she pulled the sheets away from her face and told him;to get out. She pulled the sheets over her face again when he answered,,;so then he waited a little longer and again she told him to get out;without letting him see her face. He couldn't hear either Miguel or;Earle. He opened the door and looked out. They were gone. He locked the;doors and windows and went to his room and lay down on his bed. Before he;knew it he fell asleep and when he woke up she was gone. All he could;find was Earle's boots in the hall. He threw them out the back and this;morning they were gone.;;;25;;;Tod went into the living room to see how Homer was getting on. He was;still on the couch,, but had changed his position. He had curled his big;body into a ball. His knees were drawn up almost to his chin,, his elbows;were tucked in close and his hands were against his chest. But he wasn't;relaxed. Some inner force of nerve and muscle was straining to make the;ball tighter and still tighter. He was like a steel spring which has been;freed of its function in a machine and allowed to use all its strength;centripetally. While part of a machine the pull of the spring had been;used against other and stronger forces,, but now,, free at last,, it was;striving to attain the shape of its original coil.;;Original coil...In a book of abnormal psychology borrowed from the;college library,, he had once seen a picture of a woman sleeping in a net;hammock whose posture was much like Homer's. Uterine Flight,, or;something like that,, had been the caption under the photograph. The woman;had been sleeping in the hammock without changing her position,, that of;the foetus in the womb,, for a great many years. The doctors of the insane;asylum had been able to awaken her for only short periods of time and;those months apart.;;He sat down to smoke a cigarette and wondered what he ought to do. Call a;doctor? But after all Homer had been awake most of the night and was;exhausted. The doctor would shake him a few times and he would yawn and;ask what the matter was. He could try to wake him up himself. But hadn't;he been enough of a pest already? He was so much better off asleep,, even;if it was a case of Uterine Flight.;;What a perfect escape the return to the womb was. Better by far than;Religion or Art or the South Sea Islands. It was so snug and warm there,,;and the feeding was automatic. Everything perfect in that hotel. No;wonder the memory of those accommodations lingered in the blood and;nerves of everyone. It was dark,, yes,, but what a warm,, rich darkness. The;grave wasn't in it. No wonder one fought so desperately against being;evicted when the nine months' lease was up.;;Tod crushed his cigarette. He was hungry and wanted his dinner,, also a;double Scotch and soda. After he had eaten,, he would come back and see;how Homer was. If he was still asleep,, he would try to wake him. If he;couldn't,, he might call a doctor.;;He took another look at him,, then tiptoed out of the cottage,, shutting;the door carefully.;;;26;;;Tod didn't go directly to dinner. He went first to Hodge's saddlery store;thinking he might be able to find out something about Earle and through;him about Faye. Calvin was standing there with a wrinkled Indian who had;long hair held by a bead strap around his forehead. Hanging over the;Indian's chest was a sandwich board that read--;;TUTTLE'S TRADING POST;for;GENUINE RELICS OF THE OLD WEST;Beads,, Silver,, Jewelry,, Moccasins,,;Dolls,, Toys,, Rare Books,, Postcards.;TAKE BACK A SOUVENIR;from;TUTTLE'S TRADING POST;;Calvin was always friendly.;;'Lo,, Char,, he called out,, when Tod came up.;;Meet the chief,, he added,, grinning. Chief Kiss-My-Towkus.;;The Indian laughed heartily at the joke.;;You gotta live,, he said.;;Earle been around today? Tod asked.;;Yop. Went by an hour ago.;;We were at a party last night and I...;;Calvin broke in by hitting his thigh a wallop with the flat of his palm.;;That must've been some shindig to hear Earle tell it. Eh,, Skookum?;;Vas you dere,, Sharley? the Indian agreed,, showing the black inside of;his mouth,, purple tongue and broken orange teeth.;;I heard there was a fight after I left.;;Calvin smacked his thigh again.;;Sure musta been. Earle get himself two black eyes,,;;That's what comes of palling up with a dirty greaser,, said the Indian;excitedly.;;He and Calvin got into a long argument about Mexicans. The Indian said;that they were all bad. Calvin claimed he had known quite a few good ones;in his time. When the Indian cited the case of the Hermanos brothers who;had killed a lonely prospector for half a dollar,, Calvin countered with a;long tale about a man called Tomas Lopez who shared his last pint of;water with a stranger when they both were lost in the desert.;;Tod tried to get the conversation back to what interested him.;;Mexicans are very good with women,, he said.;;Better with horses,, said the Indian. I remember one time along the;Brazos,, I...;;Tod tried again.;;They fought over Earle's girl,, didn't they?;;Not to hear him tell it,, Calvin said. He claims it was dough--claims;the Mex robbed him while he was sleeping.;;The dirty,, thievin' rat,, said the Indian,, spitting.;;He claims he's all washed up with that bitch,, Calvin went on.;;Yes,, siree,, that's his story,, to hear him tell it Tod had enough.;;So long,, he said.;;Glad to meet you,, said the Indian.;;Don't take any wooden nickels,, Calvin shouted after him.;;Tod wondered if she had gone with Miguel. He thought it more likely that;she would go back to work for Mrs. Jenning. But either way she would come;out all right. Nothing could hurt her. She was like a cork. No matter how;rough the sea got,, she would go dancing over the same waves that sank;iron ships and tore away piers of reinforced concrete. He pictured her;riding a tremendous sea. Wave after wave reared its ton on ton of solid;water and crashed down only to have her spin gaily away.;;When he arrived at Musso Frank's restaurant,, he ordered a steak and a;double Scotch. The drink came first and he sipped it with his inner eye;still on the spinning cork.;;It was a very pretty cork,, gilt with a glittering fragment of mirror set;in its top. The sea in which it danced was beautiful,, green in the trough;of the waves and silver at their tips. But for all their moon-driven;power,, they could do no more than net the bright cork for a moment in a;spume of intricate lace. Finally it was set down on a strange shore where;a savage with pork-sausage fingers and a pimpled butt picked it up and;hugged it to his sagging belly. Tod recognized the fortunate man,; he was;one of Mrs. Kenning's customers.;;The waiter brought his order and paused with bent back for him to;comment. In vain. Tod was far too busy to inspect the steak.;;Satisfactory,, sir? asked the waiter.;;Tod waved him away with a gesture more often used on flies. The waiter;disappeared. Tod tried the same gesture on what he felt,, but the driving;itch refused to go. If only he had the courage to wait for her some night;and hit her with a bottle and rape her.;;He knew what it would be like lurking in the dark in a vacant lot,,;waiting for her. Whatever that bird was that sang at night in California;would be bursting its heart in theatrical runs and quavers and the chill;night air would smell of spice pink. She would drive up,, turn the motor;off,, look up at the stars,, so that her breasts reared,, then toss her head;and sigh. She would throw the ignition keys into her purse and snap it;shut,, then get out of the car. The long step she took would make her;tight dress pull up so that an inch of glowing flesh would show above her;black stocking. As he approached carefully,, she would be pulling her;dress down,, smoothing it nicely over her hips.;;Faye,, Faye,, just a minute,, he would call.;;Why,, Tod,, hello.;;She would hold her hand out to him at the end of her long arm that;swooped so gracefully to join her curving shoulder.;;You scared me!;;She would look like a deer on the edge of the road when a truck comes;unexpectedly around a bend.;;He could feel the cold bottle he held behind his back and the forward;step he would take to bring...Is there anything wrong with it,, sir?;;The fly-like waiter had come back. Tod waved at him,, but this time the;man continued to hover.;;Perhaps you would like me to take it back,, sir?;;No,, no.;;Thank you,, sir.;;But he didn't leave. He waited to make sure that the customer was really;going to eat. Tod picked up his knife and cut a piece. Not until he had;also put some boiled potato in his mouth did the man leave.;;Tod tried to start the rape going again,, but he couldn't feel the bottle;as he raised it to strike. He had to give it up. The waiter came back.;Tod looked at the steak. It was a very good one,, but he wasn't hungry any;more.;;A check,, please.;;No dessert,, sir?;;No,, thank you,, just a check.;;Check it is,, sir,, the man said brightly as he fumbled for his pad and;pencil.;;;27;;;When Tod reached the street,, he saw a dozen great violet shafts of light;moving across the evening sky in wide crazy sweeps. Whenever one of the;fiery columns reached the lowest point of its arc,, it lit for a moment;the rose-colored domes and delicate minarets of Kahn's Persian Palace;Theatre. The purpose of this display was to signal the world premiere of;a new picture.;;Turning his back on the searchlights,, he started in the opposite;direction,, toward Homer's place. Before he had gone very far,, he saw a;clock that read a quarter past six and changed his mind about going back;just yet. He might as well let the poor fellow sleep for another hour and;kill some time by looking at the crowds.;;When still a block from the theatre,, he saw an enormous electric sign;that hung over the middle of the street. In letters ten feet high he read;that;;MR. KAHN A PLEASURE DOME DECREED;;Although it was still several hours before the celebrities would arrive,,;thousands of people had already gathered. They stood facing the theatre;with their backs toward the gutter in a thick line hundreds of feet long.;A big squad of policemen was trying to keep a lane open between the front;rank of the crowd and the facade of the theatre.;;Tod entered the lane while the policeman guarding it was busy with a;woman whose parcel had torn open,, dropping oranges all over the place.;Another policeman shouted for him to get the hell across the street,, but;he took a chance and kept going. They had enough to do without chasing;him. He noticed how worried they looked and how careful they tried to be.;If they had to arrest someone,, they joked good-naturedly with the;culprit,, making light of it until they got him around the corner,, then;they whaled him with their clubs. Only so long as the man was actually;part of the crowd did they have to be gentle.;;Tod had walked only a short distance along the narrow lane when he began;to get frightened. People shouted,, commenting on his hat,, his carriage,,;and his clothing. There was a continuous roar of catcalls,, laughter and;yells,, pierced occasionally by a scream. The scream was usually followed;by a sudden movement in the dense mass and part of it would surge forward;wherever the police line was weakest. As soon as that part was rammed;back,, the bulge would pop out somewhere else.;;The police force would have to be doubled when the stars started to;arrive. At the sight of their heroes and heroines,, the crowd would turn;demoniac. Some little gesture,, either too pleasing or too offensive,,;would start it moving and then nothing but machine guns would stop it.;Individually the purpose of its members might simply be to get a;souvenir,, but collectively it would grab and rend.;;A young man with a portable microphone was describing the scene. His;rapid,, hysterical voice was like that of a revivalist preacher whipping;his congregation toward the ecstasy of fits.;;What a crowd,, folks! What a crowd! There must be ten thousand excited,,;screaming fans outside Kahn's Persian tonight. The police can't hold;them. Here,, listen to them roar.;;He held the microphone out and those near it obligingly roared for him.;;Did you hear it? It's a bedlam,, folks. A veritable bedlam! What;excitement! Of all the premieres I've attended,, this is the most...the;most...stupendous,, folks. Can the police hold them? Can they? It doesn't;look so,, folks...;;Another squad of police came charging up. The sergeant pleaded with the;announcer to stand further back so the people couldn't hear him His men;threw themselves at the crowd. It allowed itself to be hustled and shoved;out of habit and because it lacked an objective. It tolerated the police,,;just as a bull elephant does when he allows a small boy to drive him with;a light stick.;;Tod could see very few people who looked tough,, nor could he see any;working men. The crowd was made up of the lower middle classes,, every;other person one of his torchbearers.;;Just as he came near the end of the lane,, it closed in front of him with;a heave,, and he had to fight his way through. Someone knocked his hat off;and when he stooped to pick it up,, someone kicked him. He whirled around;angrily and found himself surrounded by people who were laughing at him.;He knew enough to laugh with them. The crowd became sympathetic. A stout;woman slapped him on the back,, while a man handed him his hat,, first;brushing it carefully with his sleeve. Still another man shouted for a;way to be cleared.;;By a great deal of pushing and squirming,, always trying to look as though;he were enjoying himself,, Tod finally managed to break into the open.;After rearranging his clothes,, he went over to a parking lot and sat down;on the retaining wall that ran along the front of it.;;New groups,, whole families,, kept arriving. He could see a change come;over them as soon as they had become part of the crowd. Until they;reached the line,, they looked difficult,, almost furtive,, but the moment;they had become part of it,, they turned arrogant and pugnacious. It was a;mistake to think them harmless curiosity seekers. They were savage and;bitter,, especially the middle-aged and the old,, and had been made so by;boredom and disappointment.;;All their lives they had slaved at some kind of dull,, heavy labor,, behind;desks and counters,, in the fields and at tedious machines of all sorts,,;saving their pennies and dreaming of the leisure that would be theirs;when they had enough. Finally that day came. They could draw a weekly;income of ten or fifteen dollars. Where else should they go but;California,, the land of sunshine and oranges?;;Once there,, they discover that sunshine isn't enough. They get tired of;oranges,, even of avocado pears and passion fruit. Nothing happens. They;don't know what to do with their time. They haven't the mental equipment;for leisure,, the money nor the physical equipment for pleasure. Did they;slave so long just to go to an occasional Iowa picnic? What else is;there? They watch the waves come in at Venice. There wasn't any ocean;where most of them came from,, but after you've seen one wave,, you've seen;them all. The same is true of the airplanes at Glendale. If only a plane;would crash once in a while so that they could watch the passengers being;consumed in a holocaust of flame,, as the newspapers put it. But the;planes never crash.;;Their boredom becomes more and more terrible. They realize that they've;been tricked and burn with resentment. Every day of their lives they read;the newspapers and went to the movies. Both fed them on lynchings,,;murder,, sex crimes,, explosions,, wrecks,, love nests,, fires,, miracles,,;revolutions,, war. This daily diet made sophisticates of them. The sun is;a joke. Oranges can't titillate their jaded palates. Nothing can ever be;violent enough to make taut their slack minds and bodies. They have been;cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.;;Tod stood up. During the ten minutes he had been sitting on the wall,, the;crowd had grown thirty feet and he was afraid that his escape might be;cut off if he loitered much longer. He crossed to the other side of the;street and started back.;;He was trying to figure what to do if he were unable to wake Homer when,,;suddenly he saw his head bobbing above the crowd. He hurried toward him.;From his appearance,, it was evident that there was something definitely;wrong.;;Homer walked more than ever like a badly made automaton and his features;were set in a rigid,, mechanical grin. He had his trousers on over his;nightgown and part of it hung out of his open fly. In both of his hands;were suitcases. With each step,, he lurched to one side then the other,,;using the suitcases for balance weights.;;Tod stopped directly in front of him,, blocking his way. Where're you;going?;;Wayneville,, he replied,, using an extraordinary amount of jaw movement;to get out this single word.;;That's fine. But you can't walk to the station from here. It's in Los;Angeles.;;Homer tried to get around him,, but he caught his arm. We'll get a taxi.;I'll go with you.;;The cabs were all being routed around the block because of the preview.;He explained this to Homer and tried to get him to walk to the corner.;;Come on,, we're sure to get one on the next street.;;Once Tod got him into a cab,, he intended to tell the driver to go to the;nearest hospital. But Homer wouldn't budge,, no matter how hard he yanked;and pleaded. People stopped to watch them,, others turned their heads;curiously. He decided to leave him and get a cab.;;I'll come right back,, he said.;;He couldn't tell from either Homer's eyes or expression whether he heard,,;for they both were empty of everything,, even annoyance. At the corner he;looked around and saw that Homer had started to cross the street,, moving;blindly. Brakes screeched and twice he was almost run over,, but he didn't;swerve or hurry. He moved in a straight diagonal. When he reached the;other curb,, he tried to get on the sidewalk at a point where the crowd;was very thick and was shoved violently back. He made another attempt and;this time a policeman grabbed him by the back of the neck and hustled;him to the end of the line. When the policeman let go of him,, he kept on;walking as though nothing had happened.;;Tod tried to get over to him,, but was unable to cross until the traffic;lights changed. When he reached the other side,, he found Homer sitting on;a bench,, fifty or sixty feet from the outskirts of the crowd.;;He put his arm around Homer's shoulder and suggested that they walk a few;blocks further. When Homer didn't answer,, he reached over to pick up one;of the valises. Homer held on to it.;;I'll carry it for you,, he said,, tugging gently.;;Thief!;;Before Homer could repeat the shout,, he jumped away. It would be;extremely embarrassing if Homer shouted thief in front of a cop. He;thought of phoning for an ambulance. But then,, after all,, how could he be;sure that Homer was crazy? He was sitting quietly on the bench,, minding;his own business.;;Tod decided to wait,, then try again to get him into a cab. The crowd was;growing in size all the time,, but it would be at least half an hour;before it over-ran the bench. Before that happened,, he would think of;some plan. He moved a short distance away and stood with his back to a;store window so that he could watch Homer without attracting attention.;;About ten feet from where Homer was sitting grew a large eucalyptus tree;and behind the trunk of 'the tree was a little boy. Tod saw him peer;around it with great caution,, then suddenly jerk his head back. A minute;later he repeated the maneuver. At first Tod thought he was playing hide;and seek,, then noticed that he had a string in his hand which was;attached to an old purse that lay in front of Homer's bench. Every once;in a while the child would jerk the string,, making the purse hop like a;sluggish toad. Its torn lining hung from its iron mouth like a furry;tongue and a few uncertain flies hovered over it.;;Tod knew the game the child was playing. He used to play it himself when;he was small. If Homer reached to pick up the purse,, thinking there was;money in it,, he would yank it away and scream with laughter.;;When Tod went over to the tree,, he was surprised to discover that it was;Adore Loomis,, the kid who lived across the street from Homer. Tod tried;to chase him,, but he dodged around the tree,, thumbing his nose. He gave;up and went back to his original position. The moment he left,, Adore got;busy with his purse again. Homer wasn't paying any attention to the;child,, so Tod decided to let him alone.;;Mrs. Loomis must be somewhere in the crowd,, he thought. Tonight when she;found Adore,, she would give him a hiding. He had torn the pocket of his;jacket and his Buster Brown collar was smeared with grease.;;Adore had a nasty temper. The completeness with which Homer ignored both;him and his pocketbook made him frantic. He gave up dancing it at the end;of the string and approached the bench on tiptoes,, making ferocious;faces,, yet ready to run at Homer's first move. He stopped when about four;feet away and stuck his tongue out. Homer ignored him. He took another;step forward and ran through a series of insulting gestures.;;If Tod had known that the boy held a stone in his hand,, he would have;interfered. But he felt sure that Homer wouldn't hurt the child and was;waiting to see if he wouldn't move because of his pestering. When Adore;raised his arm,, it was too late. The stone hit Homer in the face. The boy;turned to flee,, but tripped and fell. Before he could scramble away,,;Homer landed on his back with both feet,, then jumped again.;;Tod yelled for him to stop and tried to yank him away. He shoved Tod and;went on using his heels. Tod hit him as hard as he could,, first in the;belly,, then in the face. He ignored the blows and continued to stamp on;the boy. Tod hit him again and again,, then threw both arms around him and;tried to pull him off. He couldn't budge him. He was like a stone column.;;The next thing Tod knew,, he was torn loose from Homer and sent to his;knees by a blow in the back of the head that spun him sideways. The crowd;in front of the theatre had charged. He was surrounded by churning legs;and feet. He pulled himself erect by grabbing a man's coat,, then let;himself be carried along backwards in a long,, curving swoop. He saw Homer;rise above the mass for a moment,, shoved against the sky,, his jaw hanging;as though he wanted to scream but couldn't. A hand reached up and caught;him by his open mouth and pulled him forward and down.;;There was another dizzy rush. Tod closed his eyes and fought to keep;upright. He was jostled about in a hacking cross surf of shoulders and;backs,, carried rapidly in one direction and then in the opposite. He kept;pushing and hitting out at the people around him,, trying to face in the;direction he was going. Being carried backwards terrified him.;;Using the eucalyptus tree as a landmark,, he tried to work toward it by;slipping sideways against the tide,, pushing hard when carried away from;it and riding the current when it moved toward his objective. He was;within only a few feet of the tree when a sudden,, driving rush carried;him far past it. He struggled desperately for a moment,, then gave up and;let himself be swept along. He was the spearhead of a flying wedge when;it collided with a mass going in the opposite direction. The impact;turned him around. As the two forces ground against each other,, he was;turned again and again,, like a grain between millstones. This didn't stop;until he became part of the opposing force. The pressure continued to;increase until he thought he must collapse. He was slowly being pushed;into the air. Although relief for his cracking ribs could be gotten by;continuing to rise,, he fought to keep his feet on the ground. Not being;able to touch was an even more dreadful sensation than being carried;backwards.;;There was another rush,, shorter this time,, and he found himself in a dead;spot where the pressure was less and equal. He became conscious of a;terrible pain in his left leg,, just above the ankle,, and tried to work it;into a more comfortable position. He couldn't turn his body,, but managed;to get his head around. A very skinny boy,, wearing a Western Union cap,,;had his back wedged against his shoulder. The pain continued to grow and;his whole leg as high as the groin throbbed. He finally got his left arm;free and took the back of the boy's neck in his fingers. He twisted as;hard as he could. The boy began to jump up and down in his clothes. He;managed to straighten his elbow,, by pushing at the back of the boy's;head,, and so turn halfway around and free his leg. The pain didn't grow;less.;;There was another wild surge forward that ended in another dead spot. He;now faced a young girl who was sobbing steadily. Her silk print dress had;been torn down the front and her tiny brassiere hung from one strap. He;tried by pressing back to give her room,, but she moved with him every;time he moved. Now and then,, she would jerk violently and he wondered if;she was going to have a fit. One of her thighs was between his legs. He;struggled to get free of her,, but she clung to him,, moving with him and;pressing against him.;;She turned her head and said,, Stop,, stop,, to someone behind her.;;He saw what the trouble was. An old man,, wearing a Panama hat and;horn-rimmed glasses,, was hugging her. He had one of his hands inside her;dress and was biting her neck.;;Tod freed his right arm with a heave,, reached over the girl and brought;his fist down on the man's head. He couldn't hit very hard but managed to;knock the man's hat off,, also his glasses. The man tried to bury his face;in the girl's shoulder,, but Tod grabbed one of his ears and yanked. They;started to move again. Tod held on to the ear as long as he could hoping;that it would come away in his hand. The girl managed to twist under his;arm. A piece of her dress tore,, but she was free of her attacker.;;Another spasm passed through the mob and he was carried toward the curb.;He fought toward a lamp-post,, but he was swept by before he could grasp;it. He saw another man catch the girl with the torn dress. She screamed;for help. He tried to get to her,, but was carried in the opposite;direction. This rush also ended in a dead spot. Here his neighbors were;all shorter than he was. He turned his head upward toward the sky and;tried to pull some fresh air into his aching lungs,, but it was all;heavily tainted with sweat.;;In this part of the mob no one was hysterical. In fact,, most of the;people seemed to be enjoying themselves. Near him was a stout woman with;a man pressing hard against her from in front. His chin was on her;shoulder,, and his arms were around her. She paid no attention to him and;went on talking to the woman at her side.;;The first thing I knew,, Tod heard her say,, there was a rush and I was;in the middle.;;Yeah. Somebody hollered,, 'Here comes Gary Cooper,,' and then wham!;;That ain't it,, said a little man wearing a cloth cap and pullover;sweater. This is a riot you're in.;;Yeah,, said a third woman,, whose snaky gray hair was hanging over her;face and shoulders. A pervert attacked a child.;;He ought to be lynched.;;Everybody agreed vehemently.;;I come from St. Louis,, announced the stout woman,, and we had one of;them pervert fellers in our neighborhood once. He ripped up a girl with a;pair of scissors.;;He must have been crazy,, said the man in the cap. What kind of fun is;that?;;Everybody laughed. The stout woman spoke to the man who was hugging her.;;Hey,, you,, she said. I ain't no pillow.;;The man smiled beatifically but didn't move. She laughed,, making no;effort to get out of his embrace.;;A fresh guy,, she said.;;The other woman laughed.;;Yeah,, she said,, this is a regular free-for-all.;;The man in the cap and sweater thought there was another laugh in his;comment about the pervert.;;Ripping up a girl with scissors. That's the wrong tool.;;He was right. They laughed even louder than the first time.;;You'd a done it different,, eh,, kid? said a young man with a;kidney-shaped head and waxed mustaches.;;The two women laughed. This encouraged the man in the cap and he reached;over and pinched the stout woman's Mend. She squealed.;;Lay off that,, she said good-naturedly.;;I was shoved,, he said.;;An ambulance siren screamed in the street. Its wailing moan started the;crowd moving again and Tod was carried along in a slow,, steady push. He;closed his eyes and tried to protect his throbbing leg. This time,, when;the movement ended,, he found himself with his back to the theatre wall.;He kept his eyes closed and stood on his good leg. After what seemed like;hours,, the pack began to loosen and move again with a churning motion. It;gathered momentum and rushed. He rode it until he was slammed against the;base of an iron rail which fenced the driveway of the theatre from the;street. He had the wind knocked out of him by the impact,, but managed to;cling to the rail. He held on desperately,, fighting to keep from being;sucked back. A woman caught him around the waist and tried to hang on.;She was sobbing rhythmically. Tod felt his fingers slipping from the rail;and kicked backwards as hard as he could. The woman let go.;;Despite the agony in his leg,, he was able to think clearly about his;picture,, The Burning of Los Angeles. After his quarrel with Faye,, he;had worked on it continually to escape tormenting himself,, and the way to;it in his mind had become almost automatic.;;As he stood on his good leg,, clinging desperately to the iron rail,, he;could see all the rough charcoal strokes with which he had blocked it out;on the big canvas. Across the top,, parallel with the frame,, he had drawn;the burning city,, a great bonfire of architectural styles,, ranging from;Egyptian to Cape Cod colonial. Through the center,, winding from left to;right,, was a long hill street and down it,, spilling into the middle;foreground,, came the mob carrying baseball bats and torches. For the;faces of its members,, he was using the innumerable sketches he had made;of the people who come to California to die,; the cultists of all sorts,,;economic as well as religious,, the wave,, airplane,, funeral and preview;watchers--all those poor devils who can only be stirred by the promise of;miracles and then only to violence. A super Dr. Know-All Pierce-All had;made the necessary promise and they were marching behind his banner in a;great united front of screwballs and screw-boxes to purify the land. No;longer bored,, they sang and danced joyously in the red light of the;flames.;;In the lower foreground,, men and women fled wildly before the vanguard of;the crusading mob. Among them were Faye,, Harry,, Homer,, Claude and;himself. Faye ran proudly,, throwing her knees high. Harry stumbled along;behind her,, holding on to his beloved derby hat with both hands. Homer;seemed to be falling out of the canvas,, his face half-asleep,, his big;hands clawing the air in anguished pantomime. Claude turned his head as;he ran to thumb his nose at his pursuers. Tod himself picked up a small;stone to throw before continuing his flight.;;He had almost forgotten both his leg and his predicament,, and to make his;escape still more complete he stood on a chair and worked at the flames;in an upper corner of the canvas,, modeling the tongues of fire so that;they licked even more avidly at a corinthian column that held up the;palmleaf roof of a nutburger stand.;;He had finished one flame and was starting on another when he was brought;back by someone shouting in his ear. He opened his eyes and saw a;policeman trying to reach him from behind the rail to which he was;clinging. He let go with his left hand and raised his arm. The policeman;aught him by the wrist,, but couldn't lift him. Tod was afraid to let go;until another man came to aid the policeman and caught him by the back of;his jacket. He let go of the rail and they hauled him up and over it.;;When they saw that he couldn't stand,, they let him down easily to the;ground. He was in the theatre driveway. On the curb next to him sat a;woman crying into her skirt. Along the wall were groups of other;disheveled people. At the end of the driveway was an ambulance. A;policeman asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital. He shook his head;no. He then offered him a lift home. Tod had the presence of mind to give;Claude's address.;;He was carried through the exit to the back street and lifted into a;police car. The siren began to scream and at first he thought he was;making the noise himself. He felt his lips with his hands. They were;clamped tight. He knew then it was the siren. For some reason this made;him laugh and he began to imitate the siren as loud as he could.;;;;THE END
