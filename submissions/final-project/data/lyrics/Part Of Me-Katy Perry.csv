;[Verse 1];Days like this I want to drive away;Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade;You chewed me up and spit me out;Like I was poison in your mouth;You took my light,, you drained me down;But that was then and this is now;Now look at me;;[Hook];This is the part of me;That youre never gonna ever take away from me,, no;This is the part of me;That youre never gonna ever take away from me,, no;Throw your sticks and your stones,, throw your bombs and your blows;But youre not gonna break my soul;This is the part of me;That youre never gonna ever take away from me,, no;;[Verse 2];I just wanna throw my phone away;Find out who is really there for me;You ripped me off your love was cheap;Was always tearing at the seams;I fell deep,, you let me drown;But that was then and this is now;Now look at me;;[Hook];;[Verse 3];Now look at me Im sparkling;A firework,, a dancing flame;You won't ever put me out again;Im glowin oh whoa;So you can keep the diamond ring;It don't mean nothing anyway;In fact you can keep everything yeah,, yeah;Except for me;;[Hook];;[Verse 4];This is the part of me;No;Away from me;No;This is the part of me,, me,, me,, me,, me,, me,, me,, me...;No;Throw your sticks and your stones,, throw your bombs and your blows;But youre not gonna break my soul;This is the part of me;That youre never gonna ever take away from me,, no
