;[Verse 1];Would you walk to the edge of the ocean;Just to fill my jar with sand?;Just in case I get the notion;To let it run through my hand;Let it run through my hand;;[Chorus];Well,, I don't want the whole world;The sun,, the moon,, and all their light;I just want to be the only girl;You love all your life;You love all your life;;[Verse 2];Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies;Yeah,, and put them in a lamp to light my world?;All dressed up in a tux and bow tie;Hand delivered to a lonely girl;To a lonely lonely girl;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Lately I've been writing desperate love songs;I mostly sing them to the wall;You could be the center piece of my obsession;If you would notice me at all,, yeah;;[Chorus];;[Outro];You love all your life;Life;Yeah
