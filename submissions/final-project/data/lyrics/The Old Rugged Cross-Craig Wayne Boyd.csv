;On a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross;The emblem of suffering and shame;And I love that old cross where the dearest and best;For a world of lost sinners was slain;;So I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross;Till my trophies at last I lay down;And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross;And exchange it some day for a crown;;To the Old Rugged Cross,, I will ever be true;It's shame and reproach,, gladly bear;Then He'll call me some day to my home far away;Where His glory forever I'll share;;And I'll cherish the Old Rugged Cross;Till my trophies at last I lay down;And I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross;And exchange it some day for a crown;;Yeah,, I will cling to the Old Rugged Cross;And exchange it some day for a crown
