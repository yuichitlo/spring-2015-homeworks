;[Intro];We come into this world unknown;But know that we are not alone;They try and knock us down;But change is coming,, it's our time now;;[Verse 1];Hey everybody loses it;Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes;And hey... yeah I know what you're going through;Don't let it get the best of you,, you'll make it out alive;Oh;;[Verse 2];People like us we've gotta stick together;Keep your head up,, nothing lasts forever;Here's to the damned,, to the lost and forgotten;It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom;;[Chorus];Oh woah oh oh woah oh;We are all misfits living in a world on fire;Oh woah oh oh woah oh;Sing it for the people like us,, the people like us;;[Verse 3];Hey,, this is not a funeral;It's a revolution,, after all your tears have turned to rage;Just wait,, everything will be okay;Even when you're feeling like it's going down in flames;Oh;;[Verse 4];People like us we've gotta stick together;Keep your head up nothing lasts forever;Here's to the damned,, to the lost and forgotten;It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom;;[Chorus][x2];;[Verse 5];They can't do nothing to you,, they can't do nothing to me;This is the life that we choose,, this is the life that we bleed;So throw your fists in the air,, come out,, come out if you dare;Tonight we're gonna change forever;;[Bridge];Everybody loses it,, everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes;Oh;;[Verse 6];People like us we've gotta stick together;Keep your head up nothing lasts forever;Here's to the damned,, to the lost and forgotten;It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom;;[Chorus][x4]
