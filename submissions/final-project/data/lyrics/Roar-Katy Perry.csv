;[Video Directed by Grady Hall &amp,; Mark Kudsi];;[Produced by Dr. Luke &amp,; Max Martin];;[Verse 1];I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath;Scared to rock the boat and make a mess;So I sat quietly,, agreed politely;I guess that I forgot I had a choice;I let you push me past the breaking point;I stood for nothing,, so I fell for everything;;[Pre-Chorus];You held me down,, but I got up (hey);Already brushing off the dust;You hear my voice,, your hear that sound;Like thunder,, gonna shake the ground;You held me down,, but I got up;Get ready cause I had enough;I see it all,, I see it now;;[Chorus];I got the eye of the tiger,, a fighter;Dancing through the fire;Cause I am a champion,, and youre gonna hear me roar;Louder,, louder than a lion;Cause I am a champion,, and youre gonna hear me roar;;[Post-Chorus];Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (x3);Youre gonna hear me roar;;[Verse 2];Now Im floating like a butterfly;Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes;I went from zero,, to my own hero;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Post-Chorus x2];;[Bridge];Roar,, roar,, roar,, roar,, roar...;;[Chorus];;[Post-Chorus x2]
