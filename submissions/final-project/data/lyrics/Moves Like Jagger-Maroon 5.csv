;[Verse 1: Adam Levine];Just shoot for the stars,, if it feels right;Then aim for my heart,, if you feel like;And take me away;Make it okay;I swear I'll behave;You wanted control,, so we waited;I put on a show,, now we're naked;You say I'm a kid;My ego is big;I don't give a shit;And it goes like this;;[Chorus: Adam Levine];Take me by the tongue and I'll know you;Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you;All the moves like Jagger;I've got the moves like Jagger;I've got the moo-oo-oo-oo-OO-oo-oo-oo-oves like Jagger;I don't need try to control you;Look into my eyes and I'll own you;With them the moves like Jagger;I've got the moves like Jagger;I've got the moo-oo-oo-oo-OO-oo-oo-oo-oves like Jagger;;[Verse 2: Adam Levine];Baby,, it's hard,, when you feel like;You're broken and scarred,, nothing feels right;But when you're with me;I make you believe;That I've got the key;So get in the car,, you can ride it;Wherever you want,, get inside it;And you want to steer;But I'm shifting gears;I'll take it from here;And it goes like this;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3: Christina Aguilera];You wanna know,, how to make me smile?;Take control,, own me just for the night;And if I share my secret;You're gonna have to keep it;Nobody else can see this;So watch and learn,, I won't show you twice;Head to toe,, ooh baby,, roll me right;And if I share my secret;You're gonna have to keep it;Nobody else can see this;;[Adam Levine];And it goes like this;;[Chorus];;[Outro];With them the moves like Jagger;I've got the moves like Jagger;I've got the moves,, like Jagger
