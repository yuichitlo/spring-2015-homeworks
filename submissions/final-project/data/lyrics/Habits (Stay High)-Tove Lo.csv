;[Verse 1];I eat my dinner in my bathtub,, then I go to sex clubs;Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on;It doesn't make me nervous,, if anything,, I'm restless;Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all;I get home,, I got the munchies,, binge on all my Twinkies;Throw up in the tub and I go to sleep;And I drank up all my money,, tastin' kind of lonely;;[Hook];You're gone and I got to stay;High,, all the time,, to keep you off my mind;High,, all the time,, to keep you off my mind;Spend my days locked in a haze;Tryna forget you,, babe,, I fall back down;Gotta stay high,, all my life;To forget I'm missin' you;;[Verse 2];Pick up daddies at the playground,, how I spend my day time;Loosen up their frown,, make 'em feel alive;Make it fast and greasy,, I'm numb and way too easy;;[Hook];;[Bridge x2];Stayin' in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end;Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain;;[Hook]
