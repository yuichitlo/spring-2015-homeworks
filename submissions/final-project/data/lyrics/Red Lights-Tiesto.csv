;[Verse 1];Blacked out;Everything faded on your love;Im already wasted so close;That I can taste it now,, now;So lets break right out of these gilded cages;Were going to make it now;Dont ever turn around;Dont ever turn around;;[Chorus];Nobody else needs to know;Where we might go;We could just run them red lights;We could just run them red lights;There aint no reason to stay;Well be light years away;We could just run them red lights [x4];;;[Verse 2];White lights,, flirt in the darkness;Whis road leads where your heart is;These signs,, something we cant ignore;We cant back down;Well never let them change us;Were going to make it now;What are we waiting for...;What are we waiting for...;;[Chorus]
