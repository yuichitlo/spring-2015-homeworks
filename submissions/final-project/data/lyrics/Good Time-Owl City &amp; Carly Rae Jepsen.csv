;[Intro x2];Woah-oh-oh-oh;It's always a good time;;[Verse 1 - Adam];Woke up on the right side of the bed;What's up with this Prince song inside my head?;Hands up if you're down to get down tonight;Because it's always a good time;Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care;Hopped into a cab,, take me anywhere;I'm in if you're down to get down tonight;Because it's always a good time;;[Chorus];Good morning and good night;I wake up at twilight;It's going to be alright;We don't even have to try;It's always a good time;;[Bridge 1];Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh;It's always a good time;Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh;We don't even have to try,, it's always a good time;;[Verse 2 - Carly];Freaked out,, dropped my phone in the pool again;Checked out of my room hit the ATM;Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight;Because it's always a good time;;[Chorus];Good morning and good night;I wake up at twilight;It's going to be alright we don't even have to try;It's always a good time;;[Chorus (x2)];;[Bridge 2] [x3];Doesn't matter when;It's always a good time then;;[Chorus (x2)]
