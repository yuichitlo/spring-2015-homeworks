;I first met the collector Christopher King on the same afternoon Hurricane Irene came whipping through central Virginia. I spent most of the drive to his home dodging cracked branches and other tree-borne detritus,, eventually parking my rental car in a giant puddle and booking it to his doorstep. King,, then forty-one,, had short dark hair that he combed back and to the side,, and a pale,, round face that suggested a certain kind of old-fashioned innocence,, although in actuality he was sharp and acerbic,, quick with an eye roll and unlikely to let anyone get away with saying anything stupid. He had a tattoo of Betty Boop on his right bicep,, which he acquired while working as a janitor,, in an everlasting bid at solidarity with his colleagues. He smoked stubby cigarettes he rolled himself from a baggie of tobacco he kept in his front pants pocket. King was precise but open-minded,, which was good,, because he would eventually end up spending a terrifying amount of time walking me through the nuances of various recorded phenomena. I was grateful for that. If I wanted to learn about records - where they were,, how they;Got there,, why it mattered - I knew I would need a tolerant sensei,, a;Patient guide;King worked as a production coordinator at Rebel Records,, a bluegrass;Label,, and County Records,, an old-time label,, both based in Charlottesville,;;He was also the owner of Long Gone Sound Productions,, a;Sound-engineering and historical music production company. On his;Office desk,, alongside a supplementary-seeming desktop computer - in;My memory it was an archaic,, Commodore 64looking behemoth,, although;In actuality it was likely a contemporary PC - sat a green Remington;Typewriter. His eyeglasses were of another era. He didnt own;A mobile phone,, and referred to mine as a smart-thing. His house in;Rural Faber,, which he shares with his wife,, Charmagne,, his daughter;Riley,, and a bug-eyed Boston terrier named Betty,, was outfitted with;An assortment of carefully vetted antiques and oddities. Like many;Collectors,, King had insulated himself from the facets of modernity;He found most distasteful. At one point he asked me if Lady Gaga was;Indeed,, a lady. He was not being coy or funny;King was flummoxed by my interest in collecting,, which he insisted;Was a mundane if not static hobby,, and he answered my questions;With barely contained bemusement. What he was compelled by was;Listening,, and the myriad ways people required and employed sound:;The question that never gets answered,, or maybe that doesnt even;Get asked,, is what is it about being human that makes us desire this;Thing that is so ephemeral?;Music,, he pointed out,, was a universally recognized salve,, and it;Was worth considering the mechanics of that exchange,, because understanding;It was the only way anyone could ever begin to explain;Why he collected 78s. Theres some sound or some group of sounds;Or some line of sounds that evokes something cathartic. I think every;Single human being has that,, from one end of the spectrum to the;Other,, he said;Accordingly,, King insisted he wasnt collecting records so much as;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 32 4/28/14 5:29 PM;33 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Performances. He liked the things,, but he needed the songs,, the catharsis - ;The records were a vehicle. I would eventually hear a version of this;Speech get recited by dozens of different collectors,, and it usually felt;Like bullshit,, but I believed King when he insisted that listening to a 78;(rather than an LP or a digital reissue) proffered him a more thorough;And transformative experience. He didnt try to define it any further;Its a fidelity thing and its also an aura,, an intangible. Im one of those;People who dont think theres much that is inexplicable,, but this is one;Of the things that I would say is inexplicable,, he said;King was born and raised in Bath County,, Virginia,, and hes never;Lived outside the state,, save a brief,, errant stint in Steubenville,, Ohio;During which he completed three days of a PhD program in philosophy;At Franciscan University. Hed previously studied philosophy;And religion as an undergraduate at Radford University and learned;The practice of collecting from his dad,, Les King,, a local teacher and;Musician who steadily accrued upright music boxes,, antique books;Victrolas,, 16-millimeter films,, records,, and other curiosities. His;Father;Who passed away in the winter of 2001,, remained a considerable;Presence in his life,, and King mentioned him frequently,, with a;Mix of devastation and approbation;As a kid,, King was often toted along to yard sales and flea markets;But his own collecting began when he serendipitously encountered a;Stack of 78s in an abandoned shack on his grandparents land. Its a;Good story,, cinematic: My grandmother had died,, so my grandfather;Wanted me to come there and help clean out the sharecroppers shed;I remember opening the door to this tar-paper shack,, and there was;A dilapidated Victrola in the room. I knew what a 78 was and I knew;How to play them,, but I had never had a profound attraction to them;Maybe what Dad was playing didnt tug at the strings in the right way;So I opened the lid and Im going through records and theres Blind;Willie Johnson,, God Dont Never Change. Then theres Washington;Phillipss Denomination Blues. Then theres Aimer et Perdre;By Joe and Cleoma Falcon,, a Cajun lost-love song. Dad helped me;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 33 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 34;Wash them. I was in eighth grade and became obsessed with going in;Peoples basements and looking under their porches. I cant tell you;The stacks of 78s people would put under their porches back then.;King started out looking for hillbilly records,, which bled into blues;Which splintered into a profound affinity for the raw and rural sounding;If theres any one continuous thread through everything that I;Have,, its deeply,, deeply rural and backwoodsy. Its almost like it turns;Its back to the city. Theres something about that,, he admitted. King;Was also preternaturally drawn to narratives of longing and discontent;To performances that sounded unhinged and uncontrollable. It was a;Preference,, unfortunately,, that I recognized in myself - a base,, possibly;Shameful desire to hear someone so overcome by emotion that they;Could no longer maintain any guise of dignity or restraint. I suppose the;Idea was that it made us feel less alone,, hearing someone else unravel;Or maybe it was a yardstick by which we could measure our relative;Damage. Or maybe it just sounded good and liberating - a kind of proxy;Wilding. King was listening for it,, constantly;He was also a guy who thought frequently about dying (he worked;Briefly,, as an undertaker) and was prone to saying things like I prepare;For death every day. Im obsessed with it. It made sense that King,, a;Collector,, would be fixated on the passage of time,, and his preoccupation;With his legacy - as a curator,, a producer,, a father - fueled much;Of his work. Look at all the blatantly transient things that,, ultimately;Are never going to last,, like Facebook postings,, he complained to me;One day on the telephone. Im definitely obsessed with the notion that;It could end just like that. Whats going to be left behind?;In actuality,, the question of what will endure has never been more;Complicated to answer. Although King would have scoffed at the notion;Its possible to argue that our digital legacies (all those dopey Facebook;Posts) will ultimately prove infinitely more enduring than our material;Legacies. They are,, after all,, replicated and indissoluble - such is;The way of the Web. These days,, there are even services to help with;The posthumous management of a digital legacy,; now,, when people;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 34 4/28/14 5:29 PM;35 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Draft wills and name executors,, they can also make arrangements with;Companies like Legacy Locker,, a safe,, secure repository for your vital;Digital property that lets you grant access to online assets for friends;And loved ones in the event of loss,, death,, or disability. Its hard not;To assume that this is how future generations will engage with and be;Edified by the past - that this is the way theyll come to understand;How humans used to live;But I knew what King meant about endurance,, about capturing;Something true. Maybe what he was actually looking for on all those;Records - what I was actually looking for - were songs that somehow;Captured the tenuousness of even being alive in the first place. Songs;That recognized,, either explicitly or implicitly,, the threat of swift and;Complete termination that all living creatures are forced to contend;With. And its not just that our existence is friable. Our happiness is;Too. Anything can fall apart;King had been involved,, in one way or another,, in many of my favorite;Reissue collections,, but the one that seemed closest to his heart;(and that best encapsulates his particular worldview) is Aimer et Perdre:;To Love &amp,; to Lose,, Songs,, 19171934,, which was released in 2012 on the;Tompkins Square label. King produced and remastered and fussed it;Into being,; all the 78s were sourced from his private collection,, and;His introductory essay is an earnest paean to what he refers to as our;Inexplicable mulishness in seeking out relationships that we know will;Ultimately both enrich us and devastate us,, more often at the same;Time. I think King found solace in the idea that bad love was an ancient;Human pastime,, and that our desperate search for (and epic bungling;Of) intimate relationships was somehow hardwired into our DNA - ;That heartache was a kind of biological inevitability. In any case,, he;Had assembled a record collection that seemed to very clearly say as;Much. Or,, as he wrote in the same notes: Many of the songs in this;Collection convey the deep despair of abandonment and loss as if the;Only precondition of our being is our ability to suffer,, to hold multitudes;Of contradictions such as regretting having done and not done the same;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 35 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 36;Thing at different times and under different conditions. It was dark;But it was true: we suffer,, therefore we sing;Kings records are neatly contained on squat,, custom-built shelves;Lining the north wall of his music room,, itself a dark and mystical;Spot - a small,, cooled space packed with vintage audio equipment;Instruments,, artwork,, and books. (If you are prone to romanticizing;Such things,, a gasp upon entry is inevitable.) King controlled one of;The best assortments of prewar Cajun 78s (his friend,, the collector Ron;Brown,, had the other),, and his stock of Albanian folk records,, a newer;Preoccupation,, was inimitable. Now that most of the coveted prewar;Blues records had been discovered or at least named,, many collectors;Had moved on to more exotic fare,, although the musical through line;Running through all of it remained clear: these were outlier records;Frenzied and raw;More important - to me,, at least - was that King is also the keeper;Of one of three known copies of Geeshie Wileys Last Kind Words;Blues and one of three known copies of Blind Uncle Gaspards Sur;Le Borde de lEau,, arguably two of the saddest,, strangest songs ever;Recorded,, a fact he summarized thusly: So,, I have two of the worlds;Most rare and most depressing 78s ever . . . if I were to be swallowed;Up,, would all the sadness disappear with me?;King was joking,, and I had not yet sunk so far as to believe that;The whole well of human despair - that eternally flush reservoir - was;Somehow being sustained or directed by two old records,, but they did;Feel imbued with a certain otherworldly import. I first heard Last Kind;Words Blues on a 2005 Revenant Records compilation called American;Primitive,, Vol. II: Pre-War Revenants (18971939) (King,, incidentally;Had remastered that collection). By then,, collectors and researchers;Had figured out the song was recorded in Paramount Records Grafton;Studio in March 1930,, but nobody knew how its creator,, Geeshie;Wiley,, had gotten to Wisconsin,, or where she came from (she might;Have spent time in Natchez,, Mississippi,, or at a medicine show farther;North in Jackson,, or - as King suggested after noting the particular way;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 36 4/28/14 5:29 PM;37 Do Not Sell at Any Price;She pronounced depot - been born and reared somewhere along the;Texas-Louisiana border),, or even what her real name was (Geeshie;Was likely a nickname,, indicating she had Gullah roots,, or was a descendant;Of West African slaves brought to South Carolina and Georgia via;Charleston and Savannah). Wiley played with a guitarist named Elvie;Thomas,, and they recorded six sides for Paramount between 1930 and;1931. Beyond that,, there wasnt even significant conjecture about her;Life - who she loved,, what she looked like,, how she died. Wiley was;A specter,, fiercely incorporeal,, a spirit suggested if not contained by;Shellac. King thought that was part of her appeal - that we could project;Whatever we needed onto her - but Last Kind Words Blues is also so;Odd and chilling an accomplishment that it effectively transcends its;Own mythology. Or at least renders it mostly subordinate;Wileys lyrics and phrasing arent idiosyncratic,, exactly,, but theyre;Rhythmically baffling in a way that makes her performance feel singular;If not entirely unreproducible - to the extent that it almost makes;Sense that the record itself is so rare. In his essay Unknown Bards,,;John Jeremiah Sullivan called the song an essential work of American;Art,, sans qualifiers,, a blues that isnt a blues,, that is something other;But is at the same time a perfect blues,, a pinnacle,, and the confusion;Sullivan references - the psychic disorientation stirred up by Wileys;Performance - ;Is maybe the only quantifiable thing about it. King;Chided me about my inability to articulate precisely what it was about;Last Kind Words Blues that I found so undeniable - why it worked on;Me,; why,, by the time she arrived at the What you do to me,, baby / It;Never gets out of me bit,, I was half-breathing and glassy-eyed - but that;Mystery was a fundamental part of its allure. In O Black and Unknown;Bards,, the James Weldon Johnson poem that gave Sullivans piece its;Title,, Johnson wrote of his own bewilderment regarding the composition;Of certain spirituals,, presenting the only useful question one can;Really ask of Wiley: How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?;Last Kind Words Blues was the first record I ever asked King;To play for me,, and I suspect its the one most people request if they;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 37 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 38;Ever make it past his front door and get a chance to start demanding;Things. Theres even an online video - shot by the 78 Project,, a pair of;Brooklyn-based;Filmmakers who traveled around recording new artists;To blank lacquer discs on a 1930s Presto Direct-to-Disc recorder - titled;Christopher King Plays Geeshie Wiley,, which is,, incredibly,, just that:;Three and a half minutes of King spinning Last Kind Words Blues;On a turntable and looking uncomfortable. At one point he scratches;His nose;If Wiley is an enigma,, Blind Uncle Gaspard is a wisp. The guitarist;And curator Nathan Salsburg sent me an MP3 of Sur le Borde de;LEau one October,, after I told him Id never heard it,; to his credit;He included fair warning (The end of [the] side sounds completely;Like hes choking up and cant go on and thank God the records over;Hes probably just got a frog in his throat . . . But it sure as shit doesnt;Sound like it,, reaching through the years and kicking you in the face.);Gaspard was born in 1880 in Avoyelles Parish in Dupont,, Louisiana;Recorded a handful of Cajun ballads and string-band songs for Vocalion;Records in two sessions in the winter of 1929 (one in Chicago,, one in;New Orleans),, and died in 1937. Id heard La Danseuse,, the Gaspard;And Delma Lachney track the collector and producer Harry Smith included;On The Anthology of American Folk Music,, and I thought it was a;Very sweet guitar and fiddle tune,, but Sur le Borde de lEau is something;Else entirely. I dont know what Gaspard is going on about (I;Dont speak enough French),, but Im certain the payoff isnt narrative;His voice is so saturated with longing that it seems to hover midair,, a;Helium balloon thats lost too much gas. It is tenuous and malfunctioning;And then it disintegrates entirely,, like the best/worst relationship;Youve ever had,, like a ghost disappearing into the mist;King acquired a copy in a trade with a collector he will still identify;Only as Paul (It sounds more Mr. Arkadinesque that way . . . Jeez,, I;Dont want to give up all my secrets!) in late 2012. When I visited him;In November of that year,, a few days before Thanksgiving,, he didnt;Make me wait very long to hear it. We decamped to his music room;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 38 4/28/14 5:29 PM;39 Do Not Sell at Any Price;With tall glasses of Turkish iced tea and he let me have the good chair;The one behind his desk,, the one that faced the speakers. I made him;Play it for me again several hours later,, right before I left,, and I sat and;Stared at the turntable,, watching the record spin,, feeling flabbergasted;Anew that anything so alive-sounding could be carved into a slab of;Shellac. I had sipped some stronger drinks by then,, but still: the entire;Experience was so disorienting that I lurched off into the icy Virginia;Night without my coat and scarf;King is well regarded as an engineer - hed been nominated for six;Grammys and won one in 2002,, which he now stores in a cardboard;Box labeled ACCOLADES - and his ability to wrangle usable sound from;Gouged and battered records was astonishing. It was so astonishing,, in;Fact,, that I periodically questioned both its origins and its manifestations;What did King hear when he listened to his records? What did I;Hear? Those discrepancies,, when and if they existed,, were they physical;Or metaphysical? Had I just blithely annihilated my eardrums via a;Catastrophic combination of punk-rock records and shitty headphones;An end-of-day blaring ritual that had eased me through several years;Of life and work in New York City? Or was it more complicated - was;It a function of need? Did King hear more because he needed more?;I can hear stuff thats on a different frequency than a lot of other;People,, King said. Its also really irritating. I can be in the living room;Reading with fans going and Betty could be in the library lying on the;Floor,, but I can hear her heart beating. Shes a small dog. I have an intense;Acute sense of hearing. Its selective,; I can turn it off when people;Are talking. Is it a form of autism? I dont know.;What was certain was that his work required a great deal of ingenuity;The turntable in his music room was littered with oddly sized bits - ;Matchsticks,, tongue depressors,, little plastic ice-cream spoons - that;He used to weigh down the tone arm based on assumptions hed made;Or things hed learned regarding certain studios or recording sessions;He accommodated for factors like ambient humidity,, or a tilt in the;Floorboards,, or a distraction on the part of the original engineer,, who;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 39 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 40;May have been daydreaming or hungry or new at the studio. When he;Was working on remastering records for Revenant Records Screamin;And Hollerin the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton,, an epic,, seven-CD;Compendium of Pattons work,, he managed to suss out a second voice;On Pattons Im Goin Home - a whole other person,, singing along;From a different room. Its definitely there,, he shrugged. No one;Knows who the hell it is.;What King did,, in these instances,, was something akin to translation;And it was useful,, generous work. Sonically speaking,, 78s can be;Intimidating - the music they contain is often ancient sounding,, so;Obscured by years and circumstance that it becomes too distant,, too;Historic,, to be properly felt. Shrouded by mythology and crackle,, its;Easy to forget that Charley Patton sang about fucking and heartbreak;And shit that pissed him off - all the same stuff people sing about now;King humanized and demystified the performance by isolating a breath;A foot stomp. Some goon waiting outside;Sometimes Kings mission had to do with how a record was played;And the shape it was in when he got it. Was the Victrola crooked,, were;People dancing so vigorously that the needle kept jumping,, was the;Record stored in a damp basement or a drafty attic? Mostly,, though,, he;Was compensating for the shortcomings of a then-nascent technology;(most records werent recorded precisely at 78 rpm,, and some werent;Recorded anywhere near that speed). The same night King played me;His Gaspard we also listened to Robert Johnsons Hell Hound on My;Trail,, a song Id heard hundreds of times before,, only it sounded different;Clearer,, more vigorous. I asked King about it. He smirked. When;I looked at his turntable,, I saw it was spinning at 79.4 rpm and that;He had placed a Popsicle stick on top of the stylus. It felt like a magic;Trick. A conjuring;Ive since consumed several of the most gluttonous meals of my adult;Life with King,, a dubious gastronomical streak that began in the front;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 40 4/28/14 5:29 PM;41 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Seat of Kings Volkswagen,, then parked outside Dudes Drive-In in;Christiansburg,, Virginia. The aftermath was bleak,, spiritually speaking;I feel like I just ate a small child,, King announced. The remnants;Of a hamburger steak sandwich quivered in his lap. I squirted more;Ketchup packets onto a cardboard boat of tater tots,, which Id strategically;Positioned on the dashboard for continued ease of access;A typewritten track listing for Mama,, Ill Be Long Gone,, a collection of;Songs recorded by the prewar accordionist Amd Ardoin and recently;Reissued by King,, was Scotch-taped to the glove box. I was careful not;To smear it. Im gross,, I mumbled to no one in particular. I took a long;Pull of Coke. My mouth was still crammed with cheeseburger. King had;Warned me about the culinary limitations of our destination - the way;He put it was,, If you flew over at night,, the area would be illuminated;With the lights of a thousand deep fryers - but we didnt try especially;Hard to circumvent that proclamation. Cursory consideration was paid;To the barbecue restaurant next door,, but their evenings scheduled;Entertainment (a pair of longhairs strumming the Statler Brothers;Flowers on the Wall) had functioned as an instant appetite suppressant;For King. I could see that much on his face;A few weeks earlier,, I had convinced King to let me tag along on a;Junking mission - the procurement of records from people who dont;Know or care to know their worth,, financial or otherwise - to the Hillsville;VFW Flea Market and Gun Show in Hillsville,, Virginia,, a sleepy;Little town in the eastern foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains,, about;Twenty miles from the North Carolina border. King had been lucky;There before,, although he also warned me that it might be a tremendous;Bust: Ive gone almost every year for fourteen years,, he wrote in an;E-mail. Some years Ive done quite well . . . Scored a [Charley] Patton;Once,, several Henry Thomas records another,, a Reeves White County;Ramblers another,, a large stack of Polish string bands another. Last;Year I came back with nothing . . . Its just like that. But it is a stinky;Dusty,, terribly early trek (you have to hit it,, and hit it hard,, early on;Friday just as the sun comes up). This,, I knew,, was how good records;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 41 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 42;Got found - not by belatedly stopping by the Jazz Record Collectors;Bash in suburban New Jersey. And while I wanted to watch King work;I also wanted to see what sorts of things I could find for myself;On the Thursday before the market opened,, I met King in his office;At County Records. Getting to Hillsville on time required driving the;Two and a half hours from Charlottesville to Christiansburg,, spending;The night,, and waking up before six to finish the trip. King was a good;Traveling companion,, not above friendly ribbing (he immediately gave;Me shit about the size of my duffel bag - which I still contend was reasonable - ;As he hoisted it into his trunk),, amenable to frequent stops;(in part so he could smoke),, and prepared to discuss,, at length,, all the;Grand failings of humankind,, both as they related to our individual lives;And to the whole of the species. (It seems like I only enter into an;Abysmal depression every year and a half or so,, and its usually because;Of having to go to Whole Foods.);We also talked about records. King had developed a marked disdain;For collectors who issued compilations of their finds but failed;To procure the necessary support documents - the ones who didnt;Provide meaningful context for the music they were promoting. As far;As King was concerned,, collectors should embrace research,, and the;Ones who refused to were dilettantes. They dont feel like they need;To fill in any information,, and so it creates this imaginary,, artificial;Mythology,, he said. Its a pretense that covers up a banality that they;Dont want to reveal to others. We just like this - we dont want to tell;You about it. The people who impress me are the people who become;So obsessed with the music that they do everything in their power to;Get the best-condition copies of the discs,, and then find out everything;They possibly can about some really obscure,, arcane musician or type;Of music. Then they provide it. They dont withhold it.;I still hadnt quite worked out how I felt about most 78 collectors;Obsessive desire to contextualize - in the worst instances,, to synthesize;Spotty research into quasi-academic narratives - and I still wanted to;Believe that these records were significant on their own merits,, inde-;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 42 4/28/14 5:29 PM;43 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Pendently of any applied historical heft. It was music,, after all. Why;Distance ourselves from it? Modern listeners,, I insisted,, didnt have;Many chances to experience art in a vacuum,, devoid of cultural currency;And freed from the constraints of time and place. Wasnt it an;Opportunity? A thing to treasure?;He didnt say as much,, but Im fairly certain King thought I was;Being naive,, if not willfully oblivious. There were some eye rolls. I;Brought up Wiley. Didnt he believe Last Kind Words Blues was good;Enough to devastate a roomful of,, say,, rural Swedes who didnt know;Anything about the country blues or Mississippi or rare 78s? Who hadnt;Yet engaged in a spirited debate about whether she says bolted meal;Or boutonniere or broken will at the end of that early verse? He;Made a face at me. Theres just too much richness to be derived from;The context of the original recording,, he said. Reckon it makes me a;Pessimist or killjoy,, even though Im a true believer in the redemptive;Power of Geeshie.;Ultimately,, King and I would end up spending more time bickering;About this than anything else - I had taken to arguing that Wiley could;Destroy anyone,, anywhere,, regardless of what he or she knew or didnt;Know - and a few months after I got back from Virginia,, when I started;Up about it again,, he sent me the following e-mail:;Heres a thought-experiment. Rather than the 78 being presented;To a bunch of rural Swedes,, Albanians,, or Greeks,, why dont you have;The actual Geeshie Wiley show up in Albania and [the Albanian clarinetist;Violinist,, and singer] Riza Bilbyl show up in Jackson,, Mississippi?;Do you think that the reaction of a bunch of rural Albanians;To Wileys music or a bunch of sharecroppers in Mississippi to Riza;Bilbyl in the 1930s would differ from their reaction right now? If so;Why? Now,, remove Geeshie and Riza and replace them with a battered;Only-known copy of their respective 78 but retain the two different;Date spreads . . . would the reaction to their greatness be diminished;Or intensified by the introduction of this base artifact rather than the;Real thing?;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 43 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 44;I mean,, he was right: time and circumstance shape our understanding;Of art in substantial ways. But what I still couldnt unpack - probably;Because I often caught myself conflating the two - was whether my;Subjective context (the fact of me,, where I live now and when I was;Born,, my understanding of heartache and what I ate for lunch) can or;Should be trumped or augmented by a more objective context (the fact;Of the song,, of how and where and why it was made). I remain a staunch;Believer in the subjective experience,, but I am skeptical,, sometimes,, of;Objective significance. As an engineer,, King was tasked with balancing;All contexts: what he wanted to hear,, what he was supposed to hear;What was actually audible. John Muirs famed assertions of interconnectedness - ;When we try to pick out anything by itself we find that;It is bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken;To everything in the universe,, he wrote in his journal in 1869 - felt;Applicable;That Thursday night,, after wed arrived in Christiansburg and scrounged;Supper at Dudes,, King and I commandeered a pair of beige-colored;$49-a-night beds at an Econo Lodge near the highway. The hotel was;Set up like an old motor inn,, with two levels of rooms emptying onto;Concrete balconies. A fleet of cable repairmen were tailgating in the;Parking lot,, slapping wads of hamburger meat onto hibachi grills and;Emptying endless cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. I entertained a handful;Of cheery solicitations while wandering around with a plastic bucket;Hoping to ice the bourbon Id brought from Charlottesville. When the;Timbre shifted from jovial to menacing,, I darted back to my room,, piled;All the unbolted furniture in front of the door,, unwrapped a plastic cup;Poured myself a drink (neat),, and fell asleep horizontally with all of;My clothes still on;King and I had agreed to meet up in the lobby at six A.M. sharp;Before Id left New York for Virginia,, Id asked King if I needed to;Bring anything in particular with me. Hed sent this advice,, which I was;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 44 4/28/14 5:29 PM;45 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Tempted to print out and tape to the inside of my closet door,, like Joan;Didion in The White Album:;So,, you should pack:;A) water-bottle;B) knapsack;C) comfortable shoes that you can burn afterwards (Ive read that;Ladies in New York do this all the time,, so this is more of an;Afterthought);D) handkerchiefs (viewed from the moon,, Hillsville at noon would;Appear to be a dust storm,, as if it were over the Sahara);E) change of clothes or two (I even offend myself after three or;Four hours at the market);F) a disbelief in what humanity can bear;It seemed comprehensive - and applicable to a variety of reporting;Scenarios. I dressed in a pair of cutoff Levis,, a white tank top,, and my;Old Converse sneakers. I filled my water bottle from the bathroom;Tap,, secured it in my backpack with my cell phone,, notebook,, pens;And recorder. I pulled my hair into a knot on top of my head. I rubbed;My eyes. I felt like I was preparing myself for battle,, or for indoctrination;Into some brotherhood of shared trauma. I dragged the furniture;Away from the door,, strapped on my backpack,, and walked outside and;Toward;The lobby;The moon - a blue moon,, incidentally,, which felt portentous even;From the Econo Lodge parking lot,, typically a romance-obliterating sort;Of place - was still sunken and teeming in the sky. Despite the lack of;Sun it was already hot,, or maybe just moist,; every time I inhaled,, I felt;Bloated,, sticky from the inside out. While I waited for King to appear;I poured myself a cup of tepid coffee from the lobby pot and watched;The local news on TV. A skinny teenager named Levi Moneyhunt was;Being interviewed regarding his participation in something called the;Catawba Farm Fest,, which seemed to involve him playing old-time;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 45 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 46;Music on a yellow Flying V electric guitar. I was underlining the words;Levi Moneyhunt in my notebook when King arrived. He was dressed;In jeans and a tucked-in brown T-shirt. His leather-and-canvas rucksack;Contained an antique record-carrying case,, complete with cardboard;Separators,, where he could stow and protect his purchases;Following a brief consultation,, we decided to take breakfast at the;Waffle House on the other side of the parking lot. I ordered a plate of;Fried eggs and smothered hash browns. The toast - wheat,, a concession;That now strikes me as absurd - was so thoroughly saturated with;Butter that it could no longer ably support itself. I gobbed a tiny tub of;Grape jelly on top of it and shoved it into my mouth anyway. It seemed;Smart to renew our resources,, bank some energy. While we forked our;Eggs,, King outlined his plan for the day. Wed head directly to a record;Dealer hed had luck with before - a guy named Rodger Hicks who;Trekked to Hillsville every year from Forest Hill,, West Virginia,, a couple;Hours north. King knew where his table was typically located,, and he;Knew we needed to get there early. After that,, wed walk around for as;Long as we could stand it,, looking for records concealed amid other;Relics. I asked King what I should expect,, broadly speaking. Youll want;To take a picture,, he said. Youll be stunned. By how many people;How thick the people are,, how thick the tents are,, how big the whole;Thing is,, and I guess by how disgusting it is. I told him Id seen some;Pretty grody displays in Brooklyn,, like this one time a guy in track pants;Vacated his bowels on the sidewalk outside my apartment. I received;An eye roll. We tossed down some cash for our meal,, climbed back into;The Volkswagen,, and sped off;King and I approached Hillsville from the north,, rolling through;Miles of bucolic countryside,, up and down,, smoothly,, like a surfer;Straddling his board at sunrise. There is a moment in late August,, in;The South,, where the landscape gets nearly obscene - overfed and cognizant;Of what comes next - and unleashes a final,, boasting parade of;Virility. Abundance was in the air. Just a few miles outside of town the;Yard sales started,, driveways and porches crammed with junk. Out-of-;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 46 4/28/14 5:29 PM;47 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Towners were coming,, with cash,, in pursuit of they-aint-sayin-what;And anyone lucky enough to own property along the primary artery;To the market was taking full advantage of the sudden influx,, luring;Shoppers off-course with renegade wares. Entire houses appeared to;Have been turned inside out. Traffic slowed. There was some aggressive;Browsing. People were caffeinated. King,, for his part,, was stoic;Unswayed by the siren call of unregulated product,, and by 8:40 A.M. we;Had parked at a lot in town (five dollars to the man in the overalls) and;Were marching,, briskly,, toward Rodger Hickss tent,, past the vendors;With fanny packs of small bills,, past the women tearing open packages;Of gas station donuts and unleashing tiny puffs of powdered sugar. The;Air was airless - heavy and close,, like a wet sheet;Tramping through a flea market with Chris King is oddly thrilling;Like getting tied to the back of a heat-seeking missile,, or being RoboCop;As we moved steadily toward our target,, King scanned various tables;And booths,, pointing out any vendor with a gramophone - to King,, the;Most obvious signifier of a potential shellac windfall. I cant overstate;How good he is at this,; he can turn a corner and point out a Victrola in;About 1.5 seconds. I,, meanwhile,, was distracted by nearly everything;(Oh,, I had this exact Alf doll when I was a kid!),, and for each whiskey;Decanter shaped like the Great Chicago Fire that I paused to admire;King discovered another sagging box of old media tucked inside a teak;Midcentury buffet. At this point,, he was only making mental notes of;Spots to revisit. We needed to get to Hicks by nine A.M.,, when the flea;Market officially opened and vendors could begin selling their goods;By the time we found Hickss booth,, there were already a few shoppers;Milling about,, including a collector King recognized - a soft-spoken;Older gentleman with a mustache and a buttoned-up shirt named Gene;Anderson. After I introduced myself,, Anderson let me flip through his;Want lists,, which hed slipped into clear plastic pages and assembled;In a binder - based on the contents,, he had what appeared to be a solid;Collection of prewar country and blues records on his shelves already;King,, meanwhile,, nodded hello to Hicks - a middle-aged man with;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 47 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 48;Thin brown hair pulled into a ponytail and a pair of tiny,, oval-shaped;Sunglasses - leaned over a box of 78s,, and began thumbing away. On a;Piece of cardboard,, someone had written GOOD 78S BE CAREFUL,, but;Rivulets of dew had already dripped through the tarp Hicks had strung;Up,, saturating the sign. King snorted and pushed it aside;Most of the tent was filled with used rock LPs,, 45s,, and CDs. Rodger;Hicks seemed to have some passing sense that certain old 78s were;Worth something,, although he also hadnt really bothered to follow;That thread to any logical pricing conclusions. The bulk of his 78s were;Marked at just a couple bucks,, although a few in especially good condition;Were randomly priced at $100 to $300. Some negotiation was;Expected. Almost immediately,, King nudged me and handed over a Paramount;Pressing of Blind Lemon Jeffersons That Black Snake Moan,,;Which he already owned and wasnt interested in - it was marked $250;Which was probably about $100 more than most collectors would pay;Its a powerful,, groaning song - the black snake,, in this case,, being;Both exactly what it sounds like and a useful metaphor for Jeffersons;Fear of everything he couldnt see - but was also popular,, meaning an;Awful lot of copies were pressed. I was tickled by the idea of having;It in my clutches,, but I wasnt particularly seduced by the song or its;Price. I set it down;King chatted amicably with Anderson and kept on pulling out records;I stood a few feet away,, jotting impressions of the crowd in my;Notebook (A woman in a visor holding an LP and yelling,, Jim,, look;Steve Miller! ) and occasionally peeking over Kings shoulder. I felt;Acutely aware of wanting to stay out of his way,, lest I complicate a;Delicate acquisition process. At some point,, King faux-casually asked;Anderson what hed picked up so far,, then appeared relieved when;Anderson showed him his selections. (Watching two collectors interrogate;Each other about recent - or,, in this case,, ongoing - purchases is;A little like watching two high-achieving middle school students warily;Prod each other about a grade: Whatd you get? What? Whatd you;Get? What?);Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 48 4/28/14 5:29 PM;49 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Finally Anderson paid for his records and ambled off,, and King;Showed me the 78s hed pulled,, which included two notable rarities:;Eddie Head and His Familys Down on Me / Lord Im the True Vine;(one of two,, maybe three known copies,; it was priced at two dollars);And Sylvester Weavers Guitar Blues / Guitar Rag (less rare,, but in;Notable condition - an E copy,, which would replace Kings E-minus;Copy). After a bit of gentle bargaining,, King paid Hicks $100 cash for;A total of nine 78s. He knelt down in the grass and gently tucked the;Records into his case. He was pleased. I picked up a few of Kings castoffs;Including 78s from Stick McGhee,, Washboard Sam,, and Blind Boy;Fuller,, and a stack of Victor pressings of early Carter Family tunes. I;Paid around forty dollars for all of it. I was beaming. King was proud;Before we walked away,, King stopped to ask Hicks what else hed;Sold that morning. Although vendors werent technically supposed;To open for business before nine A.M. on Friday (those hours would;Change to seven A.M. the following year),, many had been camped out in;Hillsville for a couple days already. With the profit margins on hocking;Old shit hovering somewhere between slight and undetectable,, you;Couldnt really blame a guy for entertaining early offers. While readjusting;His shorts,, Hicks,, already gloriously sweaty,, unpinned a grenade:;Hed sold $1,,600 worth of blues records to someone from Raleigh;Earlier in the week - probably Wednesday. Hed been in the field since;Sunday. He didnt recall the specific titles. King,, I could tell,, was ruffled;Not miffed,, exactly,, but disturbed. Hours later,, when we stopped for a;Late lunch and several gallons of sweet tea at the Blue Ridge Restaurant;In Floyd,, Virginia - King ordered country ham and I ordered city;Ham and we both got the brown beans and fried squash - he brought;It up again. I wont sleep for several weeks,, he sighed. I couldnt tell if;He was being serious. For now,, though,, the information was filed away;We trudged off,, once more unto the breach;In retrospect,, it occurs to me that if one was interested in compiling;The worlds most comprehensive collection of sweat-soaked T-shirts;The Hillsville VFW Flea Market and Gun Show would be an unqualified;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 49 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 50;Mecca. Here,, the gradual darkening of preshrunk cotton mirrors a darkening;Of the soul. It is unconscionably hot and crowded,, and attendees;Are forced to contend with several miles of gently used detritus,, all;The bits and bobs - a thousand riffs on colored plastic - humans have;Designed to ease our long,, slow crawl toward death. Surrender is required;Or else you will crumple under the weight. When a portly man;Sporting strained cargo shorts and an orange GUNS SAVE LIVES sticker;Unleashed an epic,, undulating belch a couple inches from my face - we;Were both digging,, somewhat frantically,, through a mound of stateshaped;Refrigerator magnets - I found myself not only not repulsed;But almost wanting to shake his hand;Hillsville allows for (and perhaps even encourages) sudden reinvention;And you could probably outfit an entire one-bedroom apartment;Here for $500,, particularly if you subscribe to the odd old stuff;Aesthetic (which seized Brooklyn,, at least,, several years ago,, and to;Which I continue to shamefully adhere). But even if you dont,, there;Is copious bounty to be ravaged: hand-carved Victorian bed frames;And kitschy Atomic Age knickknacks and gold-and-ivory pocketknives;Are plentiful,, but so are dented Ikea nightstands and used Cabbage;Patch dolls and Duracell batteries of unknown origin. It is a feast of;Accumulation,, presented without judgment or categorization. I was;Instantly reminded of Donovan Hohns A Romance of Rust: Nostalgia;Progress,, and the Meaning of Tools,, a 2005 Harpers essay in which;The author visits the barn of an antique tool collector and is struck by;How zoological his collection appears. Divorced from usefulness and;Subjected to morphological classification,, they looked like the fossils;Of Cenozoic mollusks or the wristbones of tyrannosaurs,, Hohn wrote;Of his subjects prizes;There is no sense of genus or species at Hillsville - everything is;Everything - but product,, detached from both its intended use and;The codified retail experience,, becomes ungrounded,, ill defined,, and;Increasingly absurd: all parts and no corresponding whole. After less;Than an hour of browsing,, the merchandise at Hillsville resembled a;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 50 4/28/14 5:29 PM;51 Do Not Sell at Any Price;Word Id said too much - as if Id accidentally subtracted all meaning;Via blind repetition,, as if it had never had any meaning at all. Particularly;Upsetting were objects of recent vintage: piles of video games;From 2011,, hardcover installments of Harry Potter,, an unopened Cuisinart;Panini press. Hohn,, at an estate auction,, remarked how an ink-jet;Printer,, still in its original box,, had already passed into that limbo of;Worthlessness that exists between novelty and nostalgia,, and,, looking;Across the fields,, I recognized that vast and endless void - the terrain;Of the freshly outmoded,, of that which is neither useful nor evocative;Obviously,, none of this slowed us down. Existential duress has no;Place at Hillsville,; it is softened or eradicated by the consumption of;Deep-fried foodstuffs. Available at one tent near the entrance were;Deep-fried Reeses peanut butter cups,, Oreos,, Twinkies,, Milky Way;Bars,, Snickers bars,, Three Musketeers bars,, and - for dessert - frozen;Cheesecake hand-dipped in chocolate. Near the gun section of the;Market (an old VFW hall overloaded with every kind of assault weapon;Imaginable,, some in shades of pink for the lady in your life),, a scrum;Of hunters in tank tops were selling taxidermy and assorted sundries;(dustpans,, bathroom scales,, plastic nativity figures) from the back of a;Pickup truck. I paused to admire a white-tailed deer head mounted on;A slab of oak,, a steal at twenty dollars,, and scratched it behind its ears;Until King gave me a look that said,, Dont do that. Later,, he did nod;Approvingly when I purchased an old puzzle,, copyrighted in 1981 and;Called Feelings. It consisted of five wooden cutouts of a young girl in;Varying throes of emotion - Sad,, Afraid,, Angry,, Happy,, and Love - and;Required users to match her face with a corresponding title. Still,, as I;Was paying,, he couldnt resist this: That would be so much better if it;Had been made in 1975.;We also looked for 78s - in Victrola cabinets,, under piles of John;Denver LPs,, wrapped in sheets of yellowed newspaper,, in the backseats;Of vendors cars,, shoved under tables,, in blue Tupperware bins labeled;OLD RECORDS,, stacked indiscriminately in the high,, bleating sun - but;Despite several hours of thorough digging,, little else of note emerged;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 51 4/28/14 5:29 PM;Amanda Petrusich 52;From the fields. There were good records there - commercial country;Like Hank Williams,; Little Wonder discs,, which are just five inches in;Diameter and contain a minute or so of novelty music - but nothing;Of immediate consequence for King. So goes junking. The Eddie Head;And Sylvester Weaver records were enough to make the trip worthwhile;For him;We began hiking the five thousand miles back to Kings car. I had;Started to register several unsettling smells. Of particular impact was;The aroma set free each time someone stumbled out of a Porta-John;Freeing its cooked contents - that vile steam - into the air. I experienced;An overwhelming urge to both wash my hands and to dry-heave;My hair had mostly loosed itself from its bun and was sticking to the;Sides of my face in new and interesting ways. The Volkswagen,, when;We arrived,, felt like a life raft;I collapsed inside,, and we zoomed out of Hillsville and toward;Floyd,, where we stopped to visit Kings coworkers at the County Records;Store,, and then,, several hours later,, to Charlottesville,, where King;Deposited me at the airport,, but not before making sure my records;Were properly packed with cardboard and bubble wrap. At the security;Checkpoint,, I got pulled aside for extra screening - Miss,, whatre;These? - but eventually made it to my gate,, where I sat doodling in my;Notebook and wondering if I should go back to the bathroom and toss;Another fistful of cold water on my face. Every few minutes,, I unzipped;My bag and checked on my records. I got excited just looking at them;I flew back to New York City feeling intensely satisfied,, if unclean;That feeling wouldnt last;Petrusich_DoNotSell_TX_PTR.indd 52 4/28/14 5:29 PM
