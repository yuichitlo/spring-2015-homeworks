;[Verse 1];When I got the news today;I didn't know what to say;So I just hung up the phone;;I took a walk to clear my head;This is where the walking lead;Can't believe you're really gone;Don't feel like going home;;[Chorus];So I'm gonna sit right here;On the edge of this pier;Watch the sunset disappear;And drink a beer;;[Verse 2];Funny how the good ones go;Too soon,, but the good Lord knows;The reasons why,, I guess;;Sometimes the greater plan;Is kinda hard to understand;Right now it don't make sense;I can't make it all make sense;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];So long my friend;'till we meet again;I'll remember you;And all the times that we used to...;;[Chorus]
