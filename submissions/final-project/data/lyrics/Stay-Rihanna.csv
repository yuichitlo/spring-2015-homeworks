;[Verse 1: Rihanna];All along it was a fever;A cold sweat hot-headed believer;I threw my hands in the air said show me something;He said if you dare come a little closer;Round and around and around and around we go;Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know;;[Hook: Rihanna];Not really sure how to feel about it;Something in the way you move;Makes me feel like I can't live without you;And it takes me all the way;I want you to stay;;[Verse 2: Mikky Ekko];It's not much of a life you're living;It's not just something you take it's given;Round and around and around and around we go;Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know;;[Hook: Mikky Ekko];;[Bridge: Rihanna &amp,; Mikky Ekko];The reason I hold on;Cause I need this hole gone;Funny you're the broken one;But I'm the only one who needed saving;Cause when you never see the light;It's hard to know which one of us is caving;;[Hook: Rihanna &amp,; Mikky Ekko]
