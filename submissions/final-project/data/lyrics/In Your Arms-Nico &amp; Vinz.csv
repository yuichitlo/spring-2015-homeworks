;[Verse 1: Nico];I feel like Superman,, they gon' remember me;I think I know I can,, who says it's hard to reach?;Who's gonna stop me on the road to success?;I don't know;;[Verse 2: Nico];They tried to break me down,, but I'm still on my feet;This city's full of life,, so why is it hard to breathe?;Oh,, why did God create this world so unfair?;I don't know;;[Chorus: Nico](Vinz);Sometimes I feel like I can't run,, I can't crawl;And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all;Life is a journey where you stumble and fall;But I'm okay when I lie down in your arms;(Oh oh oh oh oh;Oh oh oh oh oh;Oh oh oh oh oh);When I lie down in your arms;(Oh oh oh oh oh;Oh oh oh oh oh;Oh oh oh oh oh);When I lie down in your arms;;[Verse 3: Vinz];I feel like moving back,, sometimes it's hard to dream;The life I chose is past,, it's moving without me;Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time?;I don't know;;[Verse 4: Vinz];My time went by too fast,, there is no one left but me;I have got a nine to five and it gets the best of me;This is the life I'm gonna live to the end,, but I'm okay;;[Chorus]
