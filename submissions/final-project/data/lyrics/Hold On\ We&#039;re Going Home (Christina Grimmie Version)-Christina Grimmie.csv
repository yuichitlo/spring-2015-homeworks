;Honestly,, Drake's platinum-selling single,, 'Hold On Were Going Home,,' doesnt need a remix but it hasnt stopped rappers from dropping a freestyle on the smooth ballad. The latest artist to do so is Rick Ross.;;On the remix,, Rozay spits a mackadoshis flow for the ladies before keeping it simple with a real n - - tempo.;;I f -  her like an addict,, she f -  me like she mad at me,, he raps. But its all cool though,, I flew her out to Nice just last week/When Im away she sends me pics in the sheets.;;The Miami Bawse later switches up to a luxury flow and spits,, Hood n - - with an escrow/Bad bitch but she special/Went home and I prayed for an angel/Appeared in the dark here to take away the pain,, too.;;Ross upcoming album Mastermind is slated to hit stores Dec. 17,, just in time for Christmas. Considering that Rozay and Drizzy have collaborated in the past (remember 'Aston Martin Music'?),, we can expect to hear another collaboration from these two hip-hop heavyweights very soon.
