;[Verse 1: Bonnie McKee];I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot;Sat on the curb drinking slurpees we mixed with alcohol;We talked about all our dreams and how we would show them all (whoa oh oh oh);I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate;And I don't need any man to be getting in my way;But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh);;[Pre-Chorus];I just keep moving my body (yeah);I'm always ready to party (yeah);No I don't listen to mommy (yeah);And I'll never say that I'm sorry;;[Chorus];Oh I'm an American girl;Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world;Hot blooded,, all american girl (Whoa) I was raised by a television;Every day is a competition Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh);;[Verse 2: Bonnie McKee];I wanna see all the stars and everything in between I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine;Cause It's a free country so baby we can do anything (Whoa);;[Pre-Chorus];I just keep moving my body (yeah);I'm always ready to party (yeah);No I don't listen to mommy (yeah);And I'll never say that I'm sorry;;[Chorus];Oh I'm an American girl;Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world;Hot blooded,, all American girl (Whoa) I was raised by a television;Every day is a competition Put the key in my ignition (Oh-way-oh);;;You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...);Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night);You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright...);Oh baby gonna go all night;;[Chorus];Oh I'm an american girl;Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world;Hot blooded,, all american girl (Whoa) I was raised by a television;Every day is a competition Put the key into my ignition (Oh-way-oh);;[Outro];Oh I'm an american girl;Hot blooded and I'm ready to go I'm loving taking over the world;I'm an American girl...
