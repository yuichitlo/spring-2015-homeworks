;[Verse 1];I`ve got my ticket for the long way round;Two bottles of whiskey for the way;And I sure would like some sweet company;I`m leaving tomorrow what do you say;;[Chorus 1] x2;When Im gone;When Im gone;Youre gonna miss me when Im gone;Youre gonna miss me by my hair;Youre gonna miss me everywhere,, oh;Youre gonna miss me when Im gone;;[Verse 2];Ive got my ticket for the long way round;The one with the prettiest of views;Its got mountains,, its got rivers,, its got sights to give you shivers;But it sure would be prettier with you;;[Chorus 2];When Im gone;When Im gone;Youre gonna miss me when Im gone;Youre gonna miss me by my walk;Youre gonna miss me by my talk,, oh;Youre gonna miss me when Im gone
