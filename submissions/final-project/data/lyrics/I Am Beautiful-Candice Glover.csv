;[Verse 1];You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud;Talk about my day and you tune me out;You keep telling me lies to make things worse;But I dont hear you;Cause Im listening to his words;;[Chorus];And he says I am beautiful;And when I fall;It dont matter that Im not perfect;I am beautiful;Im not alone;And in his eyes Im so worth it;Im worth every tear;And every scar;And even when you say Im not;He says Im beautiful;;[Verse 2];You say Ill never be good enough;Knock me down;Wont help me up;And you always say the right thing to make hurt;But I dont hear you;Cause Im listening to his words;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And I deserve better things;He says he understands;I got to do what's right for me;;[Chorus];;[Outro];He says;He says;Im beautiful;And Im worth every tear;And every scar;And even when you say Im not;He says Im beautiful
