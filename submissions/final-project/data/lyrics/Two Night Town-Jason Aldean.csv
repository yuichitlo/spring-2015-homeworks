;I just spent three nights in a two-night town;Suns comin up and Im just goin down;Am I ever gonna turn my life around;I just spend three nights in a two-night town;;It was women,, it was sinnin,, it was alcohol;It was everything the bible says will make a man fall;And I didnt wanna little lord I wanted it all;It was women,, it was sinnin,, it was alcohol;;When am I,, ever gonna learn to walk away;When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin my way;Why do I always gotta stay to long till its too late;;I just spend three nights in a two night town;With a bunch of lost souls just tryna get found;Girl Ive been a little crazy since you walked out;So I just spend three nights in a two-night town;;When am I,, ever gonna learn to walk away;When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin my way;Why do I always gotta stay to long till its too late;I just spend three nights in a two-night town;;Suns comin up and Im just goin down;But baby this pain is still hangin around;I think Ill spend four nights in a two-night town
