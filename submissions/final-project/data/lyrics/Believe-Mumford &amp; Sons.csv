;[Verse 1];You may call it in this evening;But you've only lost the night;Present all your pretty feelings;May they comfort you tonight;And I'm climbing over something;And I'm running through these walls;;[Refrain];I don't even know if I believe;I don't even know if I believe;I don't even know if I believe;Everything you're trying to say to me;;[Verse 2];I had the strangest feeling;Your world's not all it seems;So tired of misconceiving;What else this could've been;;[Refrain];;[Bridge];So open up my eyes;Tell me I'm alive;This is never gonna go our way;If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind;;Say something,, say something;Something like you love me;Less you want to move away;From the noise of this place;;I don't even know if I believe;I don't even know if I believe;I don't even know if I wanna believe;Anything you're trying to say to me;;[Bridge] x2
