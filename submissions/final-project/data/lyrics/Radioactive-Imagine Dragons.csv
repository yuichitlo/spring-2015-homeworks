;[Verse 1];I'm waking up to ash and dust;I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust;I'm breathing in the chemicals;I'm breaking in,, shaping up,, checking out on the prison bus;This is it,, the apocalypse,, whoa;;[Chorus];I'm waking up,, I feel it in my bones;Enough to make my systems blow;Welcome to the new age,, to the new age;Welcome to the new age,, to the new age;Whoa,, whoa,, I'm radioactive,, radioactive;Whoa,, whoa,, I'm radioactive,, radioactive;;[Verse 2];I raise my flags,, dye my clothes;It's a revolution,, I suppose;We'll paint it red to fit right in;Whoa;I'm breaking in,, shaping up,, then checking out on the prison bus;This is it,, the apocalypse;Whoa;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];All systems go,, sun hasn't died;Deep in my bones,, straight from inside;;[Chorus]
