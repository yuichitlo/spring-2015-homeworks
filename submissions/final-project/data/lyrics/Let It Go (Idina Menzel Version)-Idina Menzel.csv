;February,, Entry 1;;Sunday February 1st,, 2014Come on,, come on...Another celeb fan site?! I quit!;;This cold afternoon in February,, 2014,, I was searching -- again -- for just the right website that defined lyrics. I mean,, really! I have no idea what those lines in Summertime Sadness mean. Theyre so confusing! One moment shes saying that shes feeling electric,, the next,, shed happily die! I dont get this song!;All the sites Ive found so far are those that give info on what the artist said about the song. Nothing close to what I really want to find...One where they give you definitions for specific lines. And I mean DEFINITIONS,, not just plain quotes that are irrelevant to the lines I dont understand!;;Im about to shut the computer down and continue reading Harry Potter in my room,, and keep thinking about what the lyrics in Idina Menzels Let it Go mean. But then,, I saw another link. This one had a weird description,, something about her album being written for a dead boyfriend. The title of the link was Lana Del Rey - Summertime Sadness Lyrics | Rock Genius. Genius? The word caught my attention. Not a lot of websites are called that. In fact,, no website Ive visited had that in the title. None. (Also,, my smarty-pants friend,, also known as Katniss on RG,, was obsessed with intelligence and all that back then,, so the word genius had to catch my attention.);;The next click of my mouse changed my life,; I kid you not.;;Over the next fifteen minutes,, I gained so much understanding of the song that it overwhelmed my mind. I havent learned so much in school since the fifth grade! The annotations on it were extremely descriptive,, and were very easy to understand. I knew what that electric part meant (thanks,, BigBadBonj!);;I tried to click the green button with an arrow pointing upwards,, but it said I had to either login or create an account. And,, because I was so grateful for the song,, I signed up and vowed to help others understand lyrics the way those contributors did for me. I vowed to do my best on my annotations.;;Deciding on my username was hard. I didnt want plain,, old Jess Maxwell. So I tried Lily Luna Potter,, but spaces werent allowed in a username. LilyLunaPotter didnt seem right. Sometimes,, adding numbers to names and titles made them sound more official. My lucky number was three,, so a three-digit would work. My birthday was March the 31st,, so that was two threes and a one...LilyLunaPotter331 sounded just right!;;Back when I just joined,, the top of the page was advertising the new Apple RG app. The whole webpage slid down whenever I moved my mouse toward it. But I still saw the thing about how adding my first profile photo would get me 100 Rock IQ,, so I added Elsa from Frozen.;;On the same day,, I searched for Idina Menzels version of Let it Go,, but couldnt find it,, so I transcribed it and wrote a few annotations. I also texted a billion of my friends,, telling them about the site,, and a few of them joined on that day,, too.;Two hours later,, I finally shut the computer down,, and lay down on my bed to think about what Id say in my annotations tomorrow.;Already Addicted But Doesn't Know It,,;;Jess The Mess;
