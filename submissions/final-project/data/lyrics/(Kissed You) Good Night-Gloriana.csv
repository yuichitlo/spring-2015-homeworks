;[Verse 1:];I dropped you off;Just a little after midnight;Sat in my car;Till you turned off your porch light;I should have kissed you;I should have pushed you up against the wall;I should have kissed you;Just like i wasnt scared at all;;[Pre-Chorus:];I turned off the car;Ran through the yard;Back to your front door;Before i could knock;You turned the lock;And met me on the front porch;;[Chorus:];And i kissed you;Goodnight;And now that ive kissed you;Its a good night good night baby goodnight;;[Verse 2:];You couldnt see me;Watching through the window;Wondering what went wrong;Praying that you wouldnt go;You should have kissed me;You should have pushed me up against the wall;You should have kissed me;I was right on the edge and ready to fall;;[Pre-Chorus];I turned off the car;Ran through the yard;Back to your front door;Before i could knock;You turned the lock;And met me on the front porch;[Chorus];;[Pre-Chorus:];I turned off the car;Ran through the yard;Back to your front door;Half scared to death cant catch my breath;Arent these the moments we live for;;[Chorus:];And i kissed you;Goodnight;And now that ive kissed you;Its a good night good night baby goodnight;Its a good night good night baby goodnight;Its a good night good night baby goodnight;Its a good night good night baby goodnight
