;Ever since I could remember;Everything inside of me;Just wanted to fit in;;I was never one for pretenders;Everything I tried to be;Just wouldn't settle in;;[Pre-Chorus];If I told you what I was;Would you turn your back on me?;And if I seemed dangerous;Would you be scared?;I get the feeling just because;Everything I touch isn't dark enough;That this problem lies in me;;[Chorus];I'm only a man with a candle to guide me;I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me;A monster! A monster! I've turned into a monster!;A monster! A monster! And it keeps getting stronger!;;Can I clear my conscience;If I'm different from the rest?;Do I have to run and hide?;;I never said that I want this;This burden came to me;And it's laid its home inside;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];;[Chorus]
