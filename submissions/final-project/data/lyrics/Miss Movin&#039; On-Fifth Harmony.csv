;[Verse 1];I'm breaking down,, gonna start from scratch;Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch;My lips are saying good-bye;My eyes are finally dry;I'm not the way that I used to be;I took the record off repeat;It killed me,, but I survived;And now I'm coming alive;;[Chorus];I'll never be that girl again;No-oh-oh;I'll never be that girl again;No-oh-oh-oh;My innocence is wearing thin;But my heart is growing strong;So call me,, call me;Miss Movin' On;Oh oh oh oh oh;Miss Movin' On;Oh oh oh oh;Yeah;;[Verse 2];I broke the glass that surrounded me;I ain't the way you remember me;I was such a good girl;So fragile but no more;I jumped the fence to the other side;My whole world was electrified;Now I'm now longer afraid;It's Independence Day;;[Chorus];;Everything is changing;And I never want to go back to the way it was;I'm finding out who I am and who I am;From here on out is gonna be enough;Is gonna be enough;;[Chorus];;I'm movin' on
