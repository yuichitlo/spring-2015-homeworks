;[Verse 1];It dont matter what plans I got,, I can break em;Yeah,, I can turn this thing around at the next red light;And I dont mind telling all the guys I cant meet em;Hell,, we can all go raise some hell any other night;;[Bridge];Girl,, I dont care;Oh I just gotta see what youre wearing;Your hair,, is it pulled up or falling down;Oh I just have to see it now;;[Chorus];If you wanna call me,, call me,, call me;You dont have to worry bout it baby;You can wake me up in the dead of the night;Wreck my plans,, baby thats alright;This is a drop everything kind of thing;Swing on by I will pour you a drink;The doors unlocked. Ill leave on the lights;Baby you can crash my party anytime;;[Verse 2];Aint a spot downtown thats rockin the way that you rock me;Aint a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do;I could be on the front row of the best show;And look down and see your face on my phone;And Im gone so long,, hang on. Ill meet you in a minute or two;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];If its 2 in the morning and youre feeling lonely;And wondering what Im doing;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Baby you can crash my party anytime
