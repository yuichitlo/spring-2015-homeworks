;[Verse 1];I've got bi-polar disorder;My shit's not in order;I'm overweight;I'm always late;I've got too many things to say;I rock mom jeans;Cat earrings;Extrapolate my feelings;My family is dysfunctional;But we have a good time killing each other;;[Hook];They tell us from the time we're young;To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves;Inside ourselves;I know I'm not the only one;Who spent so long attempting to be someone else;Well,, I'm over it;;[Chorus];I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are;Secrets are;I don't care if the world knows what my secrets are;Secrets are;;[Post-Chorus];So,, what?;So,, what?;So,, what?;So,, what?;;[Verse 2];I can't think straight;I'm so gay;Sometimes I cry a whole day;I care a lot;Use an analog clock;And never know when to stop;And I'm passive aggressive;I'm scared of the dark and the dentist;I love my butt and won't shut up;And never really grew up;;[Hook];;[Chorus];;[Post-Chorus];;[Bridge];Eeeeeeh Oooh Ooooohhh Ooooooooh;;[Chorus];;[Post-Chorus](2x)
