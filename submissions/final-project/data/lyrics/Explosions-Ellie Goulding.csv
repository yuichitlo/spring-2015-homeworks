;[Verse 1];You trembled like you'd seen a ghost;And I gave in;I lack the things you need the most,, you said where have you been;You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide;I wonder why;I remind you of the days you poured your heart into;But you never tried;I've fallen from grace;Took a blow to my face;I've loved and I've lost;I've loved and I've lost;;[Chorus];Explosions on the day you wake up;Needing somebody and you've learned;It's okay to be afraid;But it will never be the same;It will never be the same;;[Verse 2];You left my soul bleeding in the dark;So you could be king;The rules you set are still untold to me and I lost my faith in everything;The nights you could cope,, your intentions were gold;But the mountains will shake;I need to know I can still make;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And as the floods move in;And your body starts to sink;I was the last thing on your mind;I know you better than you think;Because it's simple darling,, I gave you a warning;Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces;So watch them fall with you,, in slow motion;I pray that you will find peace of mind;And I'll find you another time;I'll love you,, another time;;[Chorus]
