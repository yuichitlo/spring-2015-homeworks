;[Verse 1];May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight;May we sing and dance till we lose our minds;We are only young if we seize the night;Tonight we own the night;Tonight we own the night;;[Interlude];La la la la la;La la la la la;;[Verse 2];When my time is over,, lying in my grave;Written on my tombstone,, I want it to say;This man was a legend,, a legend of his time;When he was at a party,, the party never died;Hey,, everybody's got a dream so what do you say;Are we making history?;;[Chorus];May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight;May we sing and dance till we lose our minds;We are only young if we seize the night;Tonight we own the night;Tonight we own the night;;[Break];La la la la la;La la la la la;;[Verse 3];For tonight I'm famous,, for tonight I'm king;And I will be remembered for centuries. They'll say;This man was a hero,, a hero of the night;When he was at a party,, the party never died;Hey,, I'm a little drunk,, but I got something to say;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];And let us wake up inside of stranger's bed;Let us drink until there is nothing left;And this night,, my friends,, we will not forget;Tonight we own the night;Tonight we own the night;;[Chorus]
