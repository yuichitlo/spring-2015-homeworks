;[Verse 1];I had a hand me down ride painted rattle can red;Second hand tires with poor boy tread;Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that;Truck that got stuck a lot;Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs;Drinking everything we could get our hands on;Learning bout right by doin it wrong;Hopin we didnt get caught;;[Hook];And we spent what little bit of money we had;On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas;Go get your girl,, go make the drag;If youre lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks;Where the man in the moon works his magic;On the second runner up of the 4H pageant;Seems like yesterday,, even though;That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago;;[Verse 2];Skipped that town on my birthday;For eighteen years I was headed that way;Where old red stopped I just stayed;In a room without a view;I met a one look girl in a two bit bar;I had a place,, she had a car;I won her heart with my guitar;I sang her the homesick blues bout;;[Hook X2]
