;I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and;I'm gonna play some flip-cup and;Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger;And throw a 20 on the corn hole game;If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid;The way that it's going,, the keg gon' be floating;;All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned;Work a little less,, play a little more;That's what this day is for;And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke;Work on my laid back,, ain't nothin' wrong;With gettin' my sun daze on,, gettin' my sun daze on;;Girl you know you're the life of my party;You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi;Stir it up as we turn on some Marley;If you want you can pet on my Harley;I sit you up on a kitchen sink;Stick the pink umbrella in your drink;The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening;;All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned;Work a little less,, play a little more;That's what this day is for;And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke;Work on my laid back,, ain't nothin' wrong;With gettin' my sun daze on,, gettin' my sun daze on;;All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned;Work a little less,, play a little more;That's what this day is for;And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke;Work on my laid back,, ain't nothin' wrong;With gettin' my sun daze on,, gettin' my sun daze on
