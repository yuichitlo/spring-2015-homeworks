;[Verse 1];If you want my love;You gotta do what it does;If you want these sweet-like-sugar Gucci lips;You gotta give it up;I know you think I'm cool;But I ain't one of the boys;No,, don't be scared that Im gon tie ya down;I need a little more;;[Chorus];Baby don't call me your friend;If I hear that word again;You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed;And I know girls ain't hard to find;But if you think you wanna try;Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye;Give me that title,, title;Come on give me that title,, title;Better give me that title,, title;Come on give me that title,, title;;[Verse 2];If it ain't no thang;I won't be hanging around;But don't blow up my shit at 3 AM saying how you need me now;Don't call me boo;Like you're some kind of ghost (well,, you're a ghost);If you don't want me seeing other guys;Well,, heres what you need to know;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];Yo,, said I'm a special kind of woman;I'm loving what you got,, but I'm hating what you doing;Ya gotta understand that Im looking for a man who can get up on a bike,, look ma,, no hands;You gotta show me off,, off;But if you embarrassed,, if thats the case I'm all gone;You gotta treat me like a trophy,, put me on the shelf;Or call me something else;;[Chorus]
