;[Verse 1];I could tell that it was over;When her lips met mine;It was an emptiness in her voice;Hesitation when she smiled;She did not have to say a word;It was just so plain to see;She had found what she would have been looking for;And I knew it was not me;;[Pre-Chorus];I saw goodbye in her eyes;I did not think I can change it;There is no way to disguise;We will never make it;;[Verse 2];Sometimes I feel like a clown;Who cannot wash off his make-up;The life she wanted,, it was gone;Prince Charming,, I was not;But I would trade a thousand Babylons;To be in her arms tomorrow;Oh,, but like the tide,, her love has come and gone;And it is time for me to go;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus];Should I hold on to what we have got?;Is it just a waste of time?;One thing that I know for sure;I saw goodbye in her eyes;;[Verse 3];I saw goodbye in her eyes;I know you got somebody new now;All my candles have burned out;He is going to love the way you shine;So did I;So do not smile at me it is not what you mean;(Goodbye);;[Pre-Chorus][x2];;[Chorus];;[Outro];I saw goodbye in your eyes;I know that it's over
