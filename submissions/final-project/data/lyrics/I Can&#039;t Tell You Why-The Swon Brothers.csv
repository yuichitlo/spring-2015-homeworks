;[Verse 1];He could be a sinner,, or a gentleman;He could be a preacher,, when your soul is damned;He could be a lawyer on a witness stand;But he'll never love you like I can,, can;;[Verse 2];He could be a stranger you gave a second glance;He could be a trophy of a one night stand;He could have your humour,, but I don't understand;He'll never love you like I can,, can,, can;;[Chorus];Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?;When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul;There may be lovers who hold out their hands;But theyll never love you like I can,, can,, can;They'll never love you like I can,, can;;[Verse 3];A chance encounter of circumstance;Baby he's a mantra,, keeps your mind entranced;He could be the silence in this mayhem;But then again,, hell never love you like I can,, can,, can;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];We both have demons that we can't stand;I love your demons,, like devils can;If you're self-seeking,, an honest man;Then stop deceiving,, Lord please;;[Chorus]
