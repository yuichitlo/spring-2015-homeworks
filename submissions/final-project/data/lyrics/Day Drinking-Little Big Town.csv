;Everybody's always waiting on Friday;Watching that clock and sitting on go;Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine;An open umbrella on the patio;;I don't need a reason or a happy hour;And hang around for a fireworks show;Get a head start a little sip of somethin';Off and running here we go;1,, 2,, 3 here we go;;Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking;We could be feeling alright;I know you know what I'm thinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;;Blame it on the work day;Blame it on the heatwave;Blame it on the tick-tock moving too slow;Blame it on any old thing you want to;Ready get set,, baby here we go;;Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking;We could be feeling alright;I know you know what I'm thinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;Day drinking,, day drinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;;Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking;We could be feeling alright;I know you know what I'm thinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;;Don't want to wait 'til the sun's sinking;We could be feeling all right;I know you know what I'm thinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking;Why don't we do a little day drinking
