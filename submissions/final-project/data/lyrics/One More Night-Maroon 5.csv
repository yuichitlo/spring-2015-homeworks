;[Verse 1];You and I go hard;At each other like we going to war;You and I go rough;We keep throwing things and slamming the doors;You and I get so;Damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score;You and I get sick;Yeah I know that we can't do this no more;;[Hook];But baby there you go again,, there you go again making me love you;Yeah I stopped using my head,, using my head let it all go;Got you stuck on my body,, on my body like a tattoo;And now I'm feeling stupid,, feeling stupid crawling back to you;So I cross my heart,, and I hope to die;That I'll only stay with you one more night;And I know I've said it a million times;But I'll only stay with you one more night;;[Verse 2];Try to tell you 'No';But my body keeps on telling you 'Yes';Try to tell you stop;But your lipstick got me so out of breath;I be waking up;In the morning probably hating myself;And I be waking up;Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell;;[Hook];;[Bridge];Yeah baby give me one more night;Yeah baby give me one more night;Yeah baby give me one more night;;[Hook];;(Yeah baby give me one more night);;[Verse 3];So I cross my heart and I hope to die;That I'll only stay with you one more night;And I know I've said it a million times;But I'll only stay with you one more night
