;[Verse 1];I drove by all the places;We used to hang out getting wasted;I thought about our last kiss;How it felt,, the way it tasted;And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine;Are you somewhere feeling lonely;Even though hes right beside you;;When he says those words that hurt you;Do you read the ones I wrote you?;Sometimes I start to wonder,, was it just a lie?;If what we had was real,, how could you be fine?;Cause I'm not fine at all;;;[Chorus];I remember the day you told me you were leaving;I remember the make-up running down your face;And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them;Like every single wish we ever made;;I wish that I could wake up with amnesia;And forget about the stupid little things;Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you;And the memories I never can escape;Cause I'm not fine at all;;[Verse 2];The pictures that you sent me;They're still living in my phone;I admit I like to see them;I'll admit I feel alone;And all my friends keep asking;Why I'm not around;It hurts to know youre happy;Yeah it hurts that you moved on;;Its hard to hear your name;When I haven't seen you in so long;Its like we never happened;Was it just a lie?;If what we had was real;How could you be fine?;Cause I'm not fine at all;;[Chorus];I remember the day you told me you were leaving;I remember the make-up running down your face;And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them;Like every single wish we ever made;I wish that I could wake up with amnesia;And forget about the stupid little things;Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you;And the memories I never can escape;;[Bridge];If today I woke up with you right beside me;Like all of this was just some twisted dream;I'd hold you closer than I ever did before;And you'd never slip away;And you'd never hear me say;;[Chorus];I remember the day you told me you were leaving;I remember the make-up running down your face;And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them;Like every single wish we ever made;I wish that I could wake up with amnesia;And forget about the stupid little things;Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you;And the memories I never can escape;;[Outro];Cause I'm not fine at all;No I'm really not fine at all;Tell me this is just a dream;Cause I'm really not fine at all
