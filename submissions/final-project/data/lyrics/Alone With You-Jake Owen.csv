;[Verse 1];I dont see you laugh;You dont call me back;But you kiss me when youre drunk;I dont know your friends;Dont know where youve been;Why are you the one I want;;[Chorus];Dont put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you cant stay;Dont slip your hand under my shirt and tell me its okay;Dont say it doesnt matter cause its gonna matter to me;I cant be alone with you...;Youve got me out on the edge every time you call;And I know it would kill me if I fall;I cant be alone with you;;[Bridge];Please dont chain that door;I cant win this war;Your bodys like a pill I shouldnt take;;[Chorus 2X];;[Outro];I dont see you laugh;You dont call me back;But you kiss me when youre drunk
