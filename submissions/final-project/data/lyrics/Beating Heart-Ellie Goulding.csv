;[Verse 1];Eyes make their peace in difficulties;With wounded lips and salted cheeks;And finally we step to leave;To the departure lounge of disbelief;;And I don't know where I'm going;But I know it's gonna be a long time;And I'll be leaving in the morning;Come the white wine,, bitter sunlight;;[Chorus];Wanna hear your beating heart tonight;Before the bleeding sun comes alive;I want to make the best of what is left,, hold tight;And hear my beating heart one last time;Before daylight;;[Verse 2];The canyon underneath the trees;Behind the dark sky,, you looked at me;I fell for you like autumn leaves;Never faded,, evergreen;;And I don't know where I'm going;But I know it's gonna be a long time;Cause I'll be leaving in the morning;Come the white wine,, bitter sunlight;;[Chorus];;[Bridge];I can't face this now everything has changed;I just wanna be by your side;Here's hoping we collide;Here's hoping we collide;Here's hoping we collide;;[Chorus];;[Outro];Wanna hear your beating heart,, tonight
