;[Produced by Ryan Tedder];;[Verse 1];It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face;I've been everywhere and back trying to replace;Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb;Praying like a fool that's been on the run;Heart's still beating but it's not working;It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring;I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing;Yeah,, my heart is numb;;[Pre-Chorus];But with you;I feel again;Yeah,, with you;I can feel again;Yeah;Woo-hoo [x4];;[Chorus];I'm feeling better ever since you know me;I was a lonely soul but that's the old me;;[Verse 2];It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face;I've been everywhere and back trying to replace;Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb;Praying like a fool,, just shot the gun;Heart still beating but it's not working;It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing;I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing;Oh,, my heart is numb;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Bridge];But with you;(I'm feeling better ever since you know me);I feel again;(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me);Yeah,, with you;(I'm feeling better ever since you know me);I can feel again;(I was a lonely soul);Woo-hoo [x5];;[Chorus](3x);;[Outro];I'm feeling better ever since you know me;I was a lonely soul but that's the old me;A little wiser now from what you've shown me;Yeah,, I feel again;Feel again
