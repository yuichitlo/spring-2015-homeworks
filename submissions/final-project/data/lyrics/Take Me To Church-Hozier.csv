;[Verse 1];My lover's got humour;She's the giggle at a funeral;Knows everybody's disapproval;I should've worshipped her sooner;If the heavens ever did speak;She's the last true mouthpiece;Every Sunday's getting more bleak;A fresh poison each week;We were born sick;You heard them say it;My church offers no absolutes;She tells me worship in the bedroom;The only heaven I'll be sent to;Is when I'm alone with you;I was born sick,, but I love it;Command me to be well;;[Pre-Chorus];Amen,, Amen,, Amen;;[Chorus] (x2);Take me to church;I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies;I'll tell you my sins so (and) you can sharpen your knife;Offer me that (my) deathless death;Good God,, let me give you my life;;[Verse 2];If I'm a pagan of the good times;My lover's the sunlight;To keep the goddess on my side;She demands a sacrifice;Drain the whole sea;Get something shiny;Something meaty for the main course;That's a fine looking high horse;What you got in the stable?;We've a lot of starving faithful;That looks tasty;That looks plenty;This is hungry work;;[Chorus] (x2);;[Bridge];No masters or kings when the ritual begins;There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin;In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene;Only then I am human;Only then I am clean;;[Pre-Chorus];;[Chorus] (x2)
