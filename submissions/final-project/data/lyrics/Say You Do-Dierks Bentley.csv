;[Verse 1];Don't worry about the damage done;Just let those words roll off your tongue;Even if you're lying;If you really don't mean it,, I don't care;If you need a little buzz to get you there;Then baby I'm buying;;[Chorus];Well couldn't you;Say you do;Say you might;For tonight;Have a heart;Bend the truth;Even if you don't;Couldn't you;Mess me up;Get in my head;Steal my t-shirt;Wreck my bed;All night long;Like you used to;Even if you don't;Couldn't you;Say you do?;;[Verse 2];Yeah baby,, I'm begging you to lead me on;Say it feels good to be back in my arms;And then don't call me;I don't mind a little smoke getting in my eyes;Baby,, take your hands,, take your lies;And lay 'em on me;;[Chorus];;[Verse 3];Well don't worry about the damage done;Just let those words roll of your tongue;Even if you're lying;;[Chorus];Say you do;Just say you do
